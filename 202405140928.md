# Project overview

VTMIS Web is deployed in Omnia Classic where the application is running on two virtual machines behind a load balancer. The VMâ€™s are running on Windows Server 2019 and have been set up by using one IIS website for the internal server and another IIS website for the external server. The local database holding the users and their access rights as well as vessels and news postings are running in an Azure SQL Database. An Azure AD Application Proxy is being used to access the web application from the internet without any VPN connection. The table below displays all the resources that are placed in the S216-ES-SCM Azure subscription. 
It uses IIS as web hosting server

It requires special authorization roles available from [accessIT](accessit.equinor.com)

| Resource Type | Resource Name | Role Name                   |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Application   | S216-ES-SCM   | S216-VTMIS_Dev_Contributor  |
| Application   | S216-ES-SCM   | S216-VTMIS_Prod_Contributor |
| Application   | S216-ES-SCM   | S216-VTMIS_Test_Contributor |


Once access has been granted, user can self-grant access to the corresponding resources by using Azure PIM (Azure Privileged Identity Management) and selecting the role that is needed.

Schedule Information
## Application URLS

* (qa)[vtmisqa.equinor.com]
* (internal app)[vtmisqai.equinor.com]
* external (external)[vtmis.equinor.com]
  
### External URIs
(vtmisi.equinor.com internal)[vtmisi.equinor.com internal]
(vtmis.equinor.com external)[vtmis.equinor.com external]

## Current project settings:

### AppExceptions        
Uses statoil.nable for logging

### DAO
Uses
Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Data dll library

## FacadeImplementation 
Exposes the web services to the client.
This project uses unknown unique of componentlibraries (.dll files) for which there is no version control nor  repository/explanation  on why they are used.

### FacadeInterfaces

### IMP
Project type: web application project 
#### Log:

### Model

### Utils

### WUI
Uses IIS deployment, therefore is necessary to run Visual Studio with administrator privileges.


### Observations
* Lack of in-repo documentation
* The whole solution uses .NET Framework 4, which is outdated
* It is composed of 7 projects that add unnecessary complexity to the solution
* Project is tightly coupled to run under windows VM due to the architecture of its design since it uses IIS Services.
* Project does not use any modern logging services (Telemetry, Azure Services, etc)
* Project does not used nuget packages and instead consumes local libraries which might be outdated
* Project publish files, urls and addressess need to be updated in the code
* Every project needs a readme.md file in order to quicly understand what it is about

# Actions that can be taken to improve the project

- [ ] Migrate all projects to .NET Framework 4.8 (Latest version)
- [ ] Move [documentation](https://statoilsrm.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/VTMIS947/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9BC856BD-78A0-498D-AF1F-9CFC7ACE3AD8%7D&file=VTMIS_WEB_runbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) into a readme.md file in the main Github repository
- [ ] Migrate DAO project from its current library to a more modern library for data access (SQL Client or Entity Framework)
- [ ] Condensate all referecne-project into a single library to reduce complexity
- [ ] Remove local .dll dependencies as necessary and implement nuget packages
- [ ] Implement logging services (Azure Services, Telemetry, etc)
- [ ] Test if project can be upgraded to .NET Core
- [ ] If build pipelines are not available, implement them to safely deploy environent-safe
- [ ] If code coverage / security scan code is not available, implement it using snyk (other security tools?)
- [ ] Make use of azure services as much as possible (Microsoft KeyVault, WebApp, etc)

### Long-term proposal
- [ ] Remove VM Dependency, and migrate to Azure App Services as for now it seems that the project can be migrated into .NET Core and thus will allow it to be containerized.

# Other questions
* Is it possible to use ENTRA ID authentication instead of local/forms authentication?
