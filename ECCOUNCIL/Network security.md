State of well-being infrastrucure with the possibility of theft, tampering and siruption og informaiton

The need of security, as technology evolces
Network renviornmetn
Rely on computer ro access technoogy
etwork environmetn
Security brach
Increasing complexity

Everything is now digitall and information security

#Confidentiality - unauthorized access
#Integrity Hash - Digital signature [[Asymetric Encryption]]
#Availability
#Authenticity Quality of being genuine
#Non-repudation - Sender cannot deny its authorship


## Triangle
Follow the triads`
Funcionality, - Usability - Security

## Challenges
Compliance
Lack of qulaified and skilled prfessionals
Difficulty  on this Distributed computing environment
Fragmented and complex privacy and data progtection
Compliance issues due to the implelmentaiton of BYOD
Relocation of sensitive data

### Impact on Information Security Attacks
Financial impact losses
Loss of Confidentiality and intregrity
Damages customer relationshiop
Loss of business reputation
Legal compliance issues
Operational impacts

**Immediate or delayed consequences and losses** 

## Essentials of Network security
Controls
Protocols 
Devices

## The goal of network defense
Forensics, PenTest
Information Assurance IA principles
Unauthorized access misuse, modification, service denial degradation and disruptions

### Information assurance principles
\Confidentiality
Avaliability
Integrity 

The triad on dats
Man-in-the-middle attacks
Non-repudation, authentication

Authenticity can be achieved through digital signatures
Authentication: Prove that you are who you claim you are

Ensure security communication 3iwwth clients and suppliers
gain competitive 

### Network defense challenges
Distributed computing environments
Emerging Threats
Lack of network security skills

0-Day threats
Overwork-Underpaid
Conflicts of interest towars where to allocate resources

### Types of netwoekdefense approaches

#### Preventive
Avoid theats / attacks
#### Reactive
Detect attacks
#### Proactive
make informed desitions on petntial attacks
#### Retrospective

Lessons learned

## Continual/Adaptive security strategy
### Protect
Eliminate all possible vulnerabilities
### Detect
Monitoring and identifying abnormalities
### Respond
Contain, eradicate, mitigate, recover
### Predict
IIDentify most likely attacks, risk analysis

## Network security controls / Administrative secuirty controls

Framework compliance
Security policiy
Employee monitoring

#### physical secuirty controls
Locks
Fences
Badge system
Guards
Mantrap doors
Biometric system
Lighting
Motion detectors
CCTV
Alarms

#### Technical security controls
Apply tech to protect data
Access contrlos \
Authentication - Prove your identity
Authorization - What are you authrozied to access
Auditing, secuirty protocols - Tracing tracking access
Network sercurity devices


### Netowrk defense elements: Technology
Required skilled people, technologi, operations

Operations

Technological implementations are by themslevs not sufficient. Should be supported bny well-defined operations

[[PEOPLE]] STILL HAS TO COMPLETE PROCEDURES
HUMAN IS THE WEAKEST IN THE SECURITY CHAIN
