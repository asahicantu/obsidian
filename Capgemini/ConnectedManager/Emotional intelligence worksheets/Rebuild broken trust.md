As a leader, you'll likely need to rebuild broken trust at some point in your career. To address your own breach of trust—or someone else’s:

1. Figure out what happened. What led to the loss of trust—a single event or a pattern of behavior? Don’t settle for the first answer you hear; dig for root causes and listen to multiple perspectives.

2. Take responsibility for the damage. Publicly assume accountability for the damage caused, apologize, and acknowledge the frustration/resentment/sadness people feel. Share examples of what restored trust would look like for your group.

3. Remedy the situation. List the changes you'll make—in systems, people, or culture—so the problem doesn’t reoccur. Let people know the timeframe for changes. Don’t overpromise, and acknowledge what you can’t fully remedy.

4. Check the results. Gather feedback on the changes. Did they help? Don’t assume the situation has improved until everyone tells you it has.
