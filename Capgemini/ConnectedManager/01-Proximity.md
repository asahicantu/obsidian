# How will I lead?
Leadership comes from how you think, act, and treat others-not from your title or personality. Know what's needed to be an effective leader, whatever your role.

____
## What defines a leader?
### Are you a leader?

Set aside your job title for a moment as you consider the question. It turns out your position or role doesn’t necessarily make you a leader—or keep you from being one.

> A leader is someone who achieves important business goals by empowering others and creating the conditions where they can thrive. * _Adapted from _Unleashed: The Unapologetic Leader’s Guide to Empowering Everyone Around You,_ by Frances Frei and Anne Morriss. Harvard Business Review Press, 2020._

Good leaders go beyond maintaining the status quo. **They look around and ask themselves: “What’s important to accomplish next?” and “How can we all grow?”** Leaders rally people around a mission and create a sense of shared purpose.

Here, David Blades, senior account manager for American Airlines, and leadership researcher Anne Morriss talk about the importance of focusing on your team’s success.

> Leadership isn't just about modeling good behavior for your team. It's also about enabling them to act on their own-even when you're not around

> I'd like to think the team would describe my leadership style as collaborative and approachable, so that they feel empowered to make decisions and aren't afraid to make mistakes, so that door's always open and the team always feels supported. And the best leaders that I've always had have definitely been very approachable and spent the time to get to know me on a personal level. 
> That's exactly how we think about it. The most successful leaders, the leaders who were outperforming all of their peers, are the ones that are totally focused on the success of their team. And the definition of leadership we now use in our work is that leadership is about empowering others as a result of your presence whenever you're in front of them and also creating the conditions where people can be empowered even when you're not there.
> Giving people permission to show up to work and thrive, which means that your capacity is multiplied by the number of people that you're able to touch. It's like becoming a superhero. This decision to lean into leadership, not only are you able to get stuff done that was impossible on your own, but people actually want to show up and do that work. They want to be around you. They can bring their whole selves into the office.

If you’ve stepped up to improve a process, coached a peer on a new skill, or helped a group reach consensus, you’ve already shown leadership—even if you weren’t in a formal leadership role at the time. *

Some days you might be able to check every box on this list—but other days will be challenging.

The truth is, leadership is a journey. **Good leadership requires energy, humility, and perseverance.** The payoff is in getting to positively influence the projects you take on, people you engage with, and work culture you’re a part of.


# Where is my biggest opportunity  for growth as a leader?

Boldness and dare to Disagree. I need to learn to feel comfortable when assessing conflict and follow my instinct when I feel something is not right for the sake of the team and not the individuals.

___

# What’s not required of leaders

As demanding as good leadership is, some qualities aren’t required.

Review what’s _not necessary_  for effective leadership.

## Possessing charisma or popularity

Not all good leaders are bold, outgoing charmers. And if that’s the image stuck in your head, you may count yourself (or others) out from leadership opportunities because you don’t fit the stereotype.

## Feeling like a “born leader”

The idea that leadership is something you’re destined for or not is a limiting belief. No one has to feel like a “born leader” to actually be a good one. * _“What’s Your Leadership Origin Story?” by Alyson Meister, Wei Zheng, and Brianna Barker Caza. _Harvard Business Review_, August 10, 2020._

## Having all the answers

No one needs that kind of pressure! In fact, the best leaders listen and ask lots of questions. They stay open to new information and are adaptable.

## Summary
Let go of any leadership myths you’ve been carrying.

Here, Harvard Business Publishing executive Ellen Bailey describes how her own misconceptions about what it means to be a leader caused her to shy away from the role at first.

By challenging her own myths about leadership, a newly promoted manager discovered the unexpected joys of the role-especially in helping her team solve problems.

### Testimonial

> For years I avoided being a leader of people. I mean, every time I called my boss it was because I had a problem that I needed help with, and I just didn't think that sounded like much fun. And so, life was good for me until my boss decided to move on. I was part of a fantastic team and my peers at the time really encouraged me to apply for my boss's job, and I decided that, _you know what, even though I was dreading that whole problem-solving piece, there were a lot of advantages and things that appealed to me about the role, so I decided to apply._  
> 
> And then I got promoted and I was now in the role being the leader of the people that were just most recently my peers. And like I did with my boss, my team is now regularly calling or pinging me on occasion with a challenge or a problem that they need help with. And so, what I realized was it's actually kind of fun. It's kind of like solving a puzzle. 
> 
> We would brainstorm and collectively come up with that next puzzle piece. It may not be the final puzzle piece, we may not completely solve it in that conversation, but we were at least moving forward. And so, I'm actually recounting this story, and I'm telling my husband, “Wow, this problem-solving thing, I don't actually have to solve their problems. What I was dreading I actually find fun because you can kind of brainstorm and collaborate together.” 
> 
> My husband's response was, “Of course you do. You like helping people.” That's when I had the aha moment, like, doink. Leading others is really not about you having all of the answers and you solving the problems. It's about having a very trusting and collaborative relationship with your team so they feel comfortable coming to you not only with the good things that happened in their day, but also with the issues and the challenges that they have so that you can enable them to best thrive.


When you clearly understand what’s required to lead—and what’s not—you can act authentically and empower everyone on your team to contribute their best effort.

# Two aspects of leadership

**Good leadership _depends_ on you, but it’s not _all_ about you.**

It requires both focusing inward and looking outward. This balancing act allows you to be effective _and_ kind, engaging _and_ productive.

### Inward focus

- Connect to values
- Become self-aware
- Create a vision

### Outward focus

- Engage and listen to your team
- Build trust
- Make decisions and execute plans


## To find an effective balance:

### Define yourself as a leader

Identify your values and vision, and connect those to your organization’s needs.

### Lead with emotional intelligence

Manage your emotions and cultivate positive relationships.

### Build trust to improve performance

Create a culture of mutual respect within your team.

### Empower everyone you lead

Understand who’s on your team, make them feel valued, and enable their growth.

### Inspire collaboration across distance

Get people connected when they aren’t in the same physical space.

Every organization needs strong leaders. **The more skillful you become as a leader, the greater your opportunities—not just in your career, but also in your life.**

## 30-Second Takeaway

- **A title doesn’t make you a leader.** How you think, act, and treat others does.
- A leader is **someone who achieves important business goals by empowering others and creating conditions in which they can thrive.**
- **Good leaders go beyond maintaining the status quo.** They ask, “What’s important to accomplish next?” and “How can we all grow?”
- **Leaders rally people around a mission** and create a sense of shared purpose.
- **Leaders pay attention to what people are thinking and feeling**, not just to what they’re producing. **They cultivate trust** and make sure people are heard, treated fairly, and respected.
- **Leaders get people connected**, even across distance.

## Take Action

What do you want to apply from this lesson as you grow in your leadership journey?


> Leadership is overall think about people and not just oneself. Once my basic needs are met then it comes to think in terms of community and let individualism go. Lead by example and observe how people behave. Have the courage to stop or say when someting is wrong.

___
# Lead with emotional intelligence
Leaders accomplish results through influence-getting others to work toward shared goals. 
Learn how to manage your emotions so you can cultivate productive relationships.

## How leaders become more effective

To advance in your career and become a better leader—whether you head up a team or not—what do you think you need?  

More experience? Greater technical knowledge? Coaching from your boss? 

These are useful thoughts, but they don't provide the full picture.

> Most often, people advance as leaders because they develop a track record of managing themselves and their professional relationships well.

_Wait, leaders are judged on relationships, not results?_  

It turns out relationships and results are inextricably linked. **Over the long term, leaders achieves positive outcomes by being someone whom others can trust to create smart plans and do the right thing.**

### What if I’ve witnessed the opposite?

We’ve all known of individuals who achieved success by being ruthless, bullying others, or cutting corners. In the long run, that kind of behavior comes at a huge cost to the organization and to the individual’s reputation.  

**There’s a term for managing yourself and your interactions well: emotional intelligence.**

In its simplest form, emotional intelligence is the ability to: 

* Understand and manage your own emotions  
* Cultivate positive relationships with others 

There are enormous benefits to leading this way. 

#### When you manage your own emotions, you:
- Make good decisions
- Handle stress well
#### When you cultivate positive relationships, you:
- Become a credible and trusted leader
- Build a team that’s creative, adaptable, and productive

Developing your emotional intelligence doesn’t mean you have to change your personality. Think of it as a tool for being your best self.

**When you lead with emotional intelligence, you’ll take your team further—and help members reach individual and shared goals.**

## Focus inward
Emotional intelligence starts with managing yourself. When you’re attuned to your own emotions—and you appropriately channel them—you’re better able to be calm and receptive toward others.

> With self-awareness comes greater self-control.

Self-management is _especially_ important for leaders, because you are responsible for making big decisions. **And whether you know it or not, your team takes its emotional cues from you.**

The first step toward managing yourself is noticing how your emotions influence how you think about and experience events.

**Emotions are powerful because they’re not just in the mind, but they’re also _physical experiences_ that affect** **every bodily system**—heart rate, blood pressure, breathing patterns, digestion, vision, and more. Most critically for the workplace, emotion impacts how your brain functions.

When emotion soars up, the ability to think rationally drops down.


## Tune in to your thoughts and feelings _* “The Focused Leader,” by Daniel Goleman. _Harvard Business Review_, December 2013.

How good are you at recognizing your emotions and managing their impact? Take this assessment to see:

Each day, make a habit of tuning in to your thoughts, energy level, and mood—even if it means reflecting on an encounter that didn’t go well.

Your goal isn’t to be robotically calm at work. That’s not realistic. Plus, emotions have real value in that they help you form genuine connections with others and enable you to make smart decisions that blend instinct and analysis.

**You just don’t want emotions driving your actions.**

#### Make a Plan

To gain greater insight and self-control, choose a behavior to practice over the next week.
a) Notice my physical reactions to stressful events
b) Pause before responding
c) Challenge automatic negative thoughts
d) Monitor my mood and energy level
e) Actively manage my stress

## Connect with others

When you tune in to your thoughts and feelings, you manage yourself better.

**When you tune in to _your team’s_ perspectives and experiences, you manage your workplace relationships better.**

> Positive relationships start with curiosity and empathy.

#### Why these two traits?

**Curiosity** allows you to learn from others. It signals humility and openness to your coworkers’ ideas and experiences.

**Empathy** helps you understand others’ feelings and what they need from you.

**One skill—listening—allows you to show curiosity and build empathy.**

Learn how effective listening works (hint: it’s _not_ simply paraphrasing what someone else says):

> Most of the successful people I've known are the ones who do more listening than talking


* Express interest, not judgment 
* Validate someone else’s feelings  
* Model kindness

Carol Kauffman, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, offers this beautiful image of empathy in action: “Walk over the bridge to where the other person is, try to see the world from their point of view, and then help them see yours.”

#### How might you show more empathy and curiosity at work?
Acknowledge that I do not hold a single unique truth, understand that I have my own biasses same as others and it is normal, acknowledge that being open to listen to different points of view will help me to understand and feel discomfort when I do not agree with someone elses opinion, but then I can keep calm and find the best way to answer and keep an understandable conversation

## Be present for your team

As a leader, you’ll juggle many different priorities at any given time. But to be trusted and effective, you need to harness your attention and focus on those around you.

During meetings—even when they are virtual—**make sure your etiquette and body language shows “I’m fully here. You and this work matter to me.”** It’s a sign of respect that boosts the group’s productivity. 

Here’s how to be present: 

##### Show that you’re paying attention
If you're comfortable doing so, face the other person when you talk to demonstrate your engagement. * _“5 Ways To Instantly Increase Your Leadership Presence,” by Carol Kinsey Goman. _Forbes_, January 18, 2016._


##### Give your opinion last
Listen more than you talk when your team is debating or brainstorming. Giving your opinion early will either shut down discussion or steer the group prematurely in one direction.

##### Be generous with your interest
Ask a follow-up question, enjoy a moment of bonding, or pursue a question that might seem tangential. The more insight you have into who people are, the more genuine your connection.

## Plan how you’ll act with emotional intelligence _*
> “Without Compassion, Resilient Leaders Will Fall Short,” by Carol Kauffman. _Harvard Business Review_, August 21, 2020._

When you’re stressed or busy, you may feel you don’t have time to check in with yourself or focus carefully on another person.

> Emotional intelligence may be last thing that comes to mind in a tense situation. But that’s _exactly_ when you need it most.

If you’ve imagined what you’ll do beforehand, you’re more likely to successfully manage your emotions and relationships in delicate situations.

Here, nonprofit executive Bryan Simmons describes how to put emotional intelligence, or what he refers to as “active empathy,” into action.

### Testimonial

A lot of managers often wonder, what is the role of emotional intelligence in their success as a leader? I generally suggest that we just eschew that term and better think about active empathy instead. Emotional intelligence sounds like something you're born with. Do you have athletic ability or not? In fact, active empathy is something that you can practice, if you consciously think about it.

Projects and organizations are successful because people are doing the work. And once people are involved, there is this intangible energy that has to be cultivated. And empathy is how you get to that place where those who are leading and those who are following are trusting each other to understand how each of them is experiencing a project, so that they can be fully available to one another to be supportive.

Just this week, I had a challenge where active empathy was required and very much in play. I had a team member work very hard drafting a communication that she had imagined that would go to thousands of followers of my organization. We had a conversation at the end of a long week. We got to a place of mutual empathy where she thanked me and said that the conversation was the highlight of her week because she somehow felt celebrated, even though I was telling her, all of this work you did will not see the light of day.

This is an employee who often takes no as a putdown, and I didn't want to do anything to discourage her. So, I took great pains to explain to her where all of my concerns were coming from. And I also made a special effort to make sure she understood that I appreciated her point of view and how she'd gotten there and why I understood all the reasons that she thought this was the right thing.

And I can see in our future together that when we confront this next time, our point of departure will be at such a higher altitude of mutual trust, that this is a gift that's going to keep paying us again and again.

Here’s a menu of strategies for applying emotional intelligence:

- Notice my physical reactions, such as my heart rate increasing.
- Pause before responding.
- Challenge and shift automatic negative thoughts.
- Monitor my mood and energy level.
- See the world from the other person’s point of view.
- Express interest, not judgment.

#### Try it Out

Which strategies will you use in these situations?

- When I need to defuse a conflict, I will first
	- Step back, notice my inner emotions, listen and then tlak
- When I need to bring a group to consensus, I will first
	- Ask open ended questions to the team
- When I need to make a difficult decision, I will first
	- Look for advice, then stay true to my values
- When I need to give bad news to the team, I will first
	- Try to highlight what we have been done right, be empathetic

As you experiment, **remember that your early attempts may feel clumsy or incomplete.**That’s okay. It’s hard to change deeply ingrained habits, but with time you’ll make progress!

Reflect on what worked and what didn’t work. Observe others in your workplace who are skilled at staying calm and optimistic and who readily forge bonds with others—and adopt some of their strategies.

**Finally, get some feedback.** Share the goal you’re working on with a trusted coworker.Explain why it’s important to you and ask them to hold you accountable in a specific way. For example, _“I’m trying to become a better listener; specifically, I’m trying not to jump in and give my opinion prematurely. If I do this in a meeting, please let me know by catching my eye.”_

Only by regularly experimenting and reflecting will you improve your skills.


## 30-Second Takeaway

- **Successful leaders develop strong track records of managing themselves and their professional relationships well.**
- Emotional intelligence helps you **manage your own emotions and cultivate positive relationships.**
- Strong emotions cloud thinking and judgment. **You're mentally sharpest when you are calm, focused, and realistically optimistic.**
- Manage your emotions by developing **self-awareness and practicing good self-care.**
- **Use curiosity and empathy to create positive relationships** with team members.
- **Plan how you’ll put emotional intelligence into action** when you know you'll face a challenging situation.

## Take Action
What’s one thing you can do to cultivate stronger relationships with your coworkers?

Be approachable, smile, talk a bit, ask questions, show openness and ability to remain approachable

# Build Mutual Trust on Your Team
Fostering trust is a critical part of the work you do as a leader. When a team isn’t performing well, investigate if trust has broken—then take steps to rebuild it.

## Workplaces run on trust

* A leader unveils a big goal, then turns the discussion over to the team to debate and decide the next steps.

* A remote team member asks for advice on a chat board; moments later, a coworker posts helpful links to relevant files.

* Members of two different departments sit down together to figure out the cause of a production glitch.

Workplaces run on trust: It’s how we motivate, influence, and stay accountable to each other. In every work culture and organization, trust is the foundation for effective relationships.

**Studies show that in organizations where people trust each other, employees are more productive, collaborative, and engaged.**

#### The Science behind this
The frontal cortex of the brain is responsible for higher-level thinking, such as analysis, creativity, and collaboration. When we feel safe, this part of the brain lights up on scans. 
But when we feel angry or anxious, the frontal cortex of the brain shows far less activity. As a result, we see fewer options, make more mistakes, act selfishly, and cling to old habits. 
Bottom line? By making your team members feel safe, you help them to be their most productive at work.



We’ve all experienced the inefficiency and blaming that happens when team members lack confidence in each other.

**As a leader, how often do you think about trust?** Do you consider whether your team trusts you and each other?

Think about your work group right now and ask yourself:

#### Does my team trust me?

No trust?

Your team may resist your ideas or not put forth their best efforts.

#### Do I trust my team?
No trust?

You’ll end up micromanaging your team, and progress will stall.

#### Do team members trust each other?
No trust?
Your team won’t work together creatively or efficiently.

## The trust triangle

**Fostering trust is one of your most important jobs as a leader.**

In order to follow your lead, team members need to believe that your **authenticity, logic, and empathy** are sound. *

![[LeadingPeople_TrustTriangle_Infographic.svg]]-

* **Authenticity:** People experience the real you.
- **Logic:** People know your reasoning and judgment are sound.
- **Empathy:** People believe you care about them and their success.

Here, Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei explains how, by paying attention to these areas, you can build trust.

> Trust is an amazingly important thing. In the presence of trust, we can do things faster. We don't have to relitigate them. Everything works better. But here's the thing, we can lose trust without even knowing it. And so, the question is, “How can I make sure I'm aware, even in remote circumstances? How can I be aware that trust is going OK?” 
And so, what we do is we've broken down trust to understand it and its three component parts. People are more likely to trust us when they believe it's the real me, with rigorous logic, and that I'm totally in it for you. The words we use for that are that I'm authentic, logical, and empathetic. And so, any time trust breaks down, it's one of those three things that's getting in the way that we want to go back and shore up. 
So, if I'm losing trust with one part of my team, it could be because they don't understand what I'm thinking. There's not the clarity there, and they're getting demoralized. Or it could be, gosh, I'm so busy, I'm forgetting to take the extra step and take care of them as human beings. Or honestly, for authenticity, it could be that I'm saying something that my team doesn't think I believe. And they think I'm saying it because someone else told me to. And that's authenticity. 
So, those are the three ways we can lose it. But if I check in on each of the component parts, then I have a chance of observing where it's lacking. And the reason we need the quick diagnosis is that the prescriptions are quite different for the three. But all three of them are easily actionable.


**People instinctively distrust those who seem fake or self-absorbed.** And yet, authenticity at work can be challenging. You can’t show up at work exactly the same way you do at home.

To be authentic at work, anchor yourself with:

* Your values: Talk about what’s important to you and why, then live your values in your actions and choices.
* Your own words: Don’t parrot company jargon or scripts—use stories, vocabulary, and humor from your own experience. People will listen keenly when they hear real conviction in what you say.
* Your leadership style:  Follow company norms as necessary, but also make choices that are true to you. For example, if people tend to deliver important news via memos, but you would rather talk with your team in person first, do it. Then follow up the conversation with an official memo.

#### Can you be your real self at work?
For some leaders, there’s another layer of difficulty. If you’re from an underrepresented group in your organization, you may have gotten signals that you need to mask parts of your identity to succeed.

Over time, if there is a wide gap between your authentic self and the role you feel compelled to play at work, it will take a toll on your psyche.

**Be courageous.** Check in with trusted mentors. Explain what makes you uncomfortable in the workplace culture and why. Help raise the issue more broadly so that important changes can be made.

To bring your true qualities more fully into your leadership practice, experiment first with smaller groups in safer settings. Ground yourself in the values, words, and leadership style that reflect the real you, and see how those efforts are received.


### Take a Moment
What types of situations—either at work or in your personal life—make you feel most confident and authentic? How can you take that confidence into interactions that are less comfortable?

When I feel safe, and i feel that I can be/show my true self


## Does my team trust me?

Let’s start with a big question: How do you know if your team trusts _you_, their leader?

**Signs of low trust show up in people’s attitudes and behaviors.**

##### Are any of these red flags familiar to you?
a) People are unwilling to admit mistakes.
b) When you ask for open input, people don’t speak up or they offer minimal contributions.
c) Team members copy you on every email and put everything in writing.
d) One or two team members really respond to you, but the rest are standoffish.


When your team is underperforming, your first instinct may be to fix the surface issues by changing a process or supervising more closely.

**But dig deeper—examine the impact your own actions and choices may have had on trust.**

- Have I acted with integrity?
- Are my standards fair and my decisions consistent?
- Am I missing skills or knowledge?

**If you can’t answer “Yes” to all three questions, take necessary action.** You might need to make amends for an error or poor decision, or become better informed.


## Tamir works to earn his team’s trust

Tamir’s team reaches a big goal, but when he congratulates the group and looks for input on the next phase of the project, he is met with silence from many team members who aren't parents.

Reflecting later, Tamir realizes that over the past month, he has only asked team members who don't care for children to work late or come in on weekends. He was trying to protect the family time of team members with children, but now he recognizes that he failed to consider his colleagues’ lives who aren't caregivers.

Tamir decides to recognize the team members who put in extra hours and to plan in such a way as to prevent the need for overtime work in the future.

Humility is powerful; it’s only through an honest examination of your strengths and weaknesses that you can grow.


### Make a Connection

Think about a problem your team is experiencing. How might broken trust be contributing to the difficulty?
Broken trust ends in a lack of delegation, or few team members overworking


## Do I trust my team? Do I show it?

There’s another part of the trust recipe: **For your team to fully trust you, _you_ have to show that you trust _them_.**

How can you do it? Make sure people have:

* Reasonable freedom over how they work
* The information they need to succeed
* Ownership of their results

**When people have control over their work and understand how their contributions matter, they feel empowered.** They accomplish more, with less stress.

Micromanaging—seeking to control and monitor every detail of your team’s work—is a lose-lose proposition.

> Micromanaging not only consumes your time and keeps you from achieving big goals—it also undermines your employees’ sense of purpose and initiative.

Autonomy doesn’t mean abandonment. Delegate work, agree on a reasonable check-in schedule, and be available for questions, resources, and coaching.


### Make a Plan

Plan how you’ll give your team greater autonomy and deeper context for the work you all do by responding to the following prompts.

- What is the project/work?
- How will you give your team greater autonomy?
- What information can you share to help the team succeed?
- Decide how you’ll support them: when and how will you check in?
## How to rebuild trust

You are human—as is everyone around you.

> At some point in your career, you’ll need to make amends for a mistake.

It may not even be your error. You may need to step up on behalf of your organization to take responsibility for a decision or policy that had unintended consequences.

To address a breach of trust:

![[LeadingPeople_AddressABreachOfTrust_Infographic.svg]]

Career coach Octavia Goredema details how to put these steps into action.

> As a career coach I work with leaders who are navigating issues of broken trust on their teams. When trust breaks down it's damaging on both sides. But recognizing the issue is the most important part, and then determining the corrective action you can take to repair the trust is the next step. Here are four steps you can take to repair trust on your team. 
Step one: Find out what happened. Allow space for transparency and the sharing of perspectives. Try using open-ended questions such as: “Can you share what caused this to happen?” This is a time to be a good listener and speak less. 
Step two: Take responsibility for the situation. Acknowledge what caused the trust to breakdown. This is important, even if you're not directly responsible for the problem. 
Step three: Resolve to move forward. Take action and list the next steps that action will take, whether that's systems, or people, or processes, and, where possible, include a time frame for next steps. It's also important to forgive yourself and forgive others by leaving the incident that broke the trust in the past. 
Step four: Follow up. Check in after the designated actions have taken place and hear how things are going. Being accountable is the most important part when it comes to repairing a relationship and recognize that it may take some time. 
The most important part is taking the actions and holding yourself and the team accountable. Rebuilding trust is hard, but these tactics will really help. And finding a way forward is possible and necessary.

As Octavia points out, repairing trust after a breach isn’t a quick process.

But if you approach the work with candor, an open mind, and a commitment to follow through, people will often end up trusting you _more_ than they did before the breach.

As you work to repair trust, listen to people’s experiences and emotions—even if what you hear is difficult or repetitive. When people feel they’ve been heard, they’re more likely to move on.


#### What if someone has broken my trust?

When someone on your team breaks your trust, you have a choice—dismiss them or give them a way back in. Don’t leave the situation in limbo, because it will make the whole team uneasy.

Dismiss the person if they lied, did something unethical, or broke a law. Don’t tolerate that behavior—it can set a bad example for the whole group.

If someone made a mistake or showed poor judgment, give them a way back in. Discuss the situation candidly. Reaffirm their skills and future potential. Talk about what they need to do to regain your trust, and explain how you will work together on this effort until they have proven themselves

Build and restore trust through small instances of safety and engagement.


“Trust is not a sweeping moment. It’s just a collection of small marbles over time.”_—Brené Brown, author and research professor_


## Quinn makes her team feel safe

Quinn leads a customer service team that works remotely. She looks for small moments to build trust—for instance, when a customer complains about how a service call was handled, she takes the time to listen to the full story from the rep who took the call.

Follow Quinn’s lead and create a culture that allows people to feel safe and affirmed, even when they make mistakes.


## 30-Second Takeaway

- **Trust is how we motivate and influence each other—**and how we hold one another accountable.
- For your team members to trust you, they need to believe that you’re **authentic, logical, and empathetic.**
- **Signs of low trust show up in people’s attitudes and behaviors,** such as an unwillingness to volunteer ideas or admit mistakes.
- When your team is underperforming, **examine your own actions and choices.**
- **Show your team that you trust _them_** by giving them **autonomy and sharing information.**
- To fix a breach of trust, **find out what happened, take responsibility, remedy the situation, and check the results.**

# Empower Everyone You Lead
Discover how to put team members in charge of their own work and create an inclusive environment in which everyone can develop and fully contribute.

## Know your team members

As a leader, your greatest resources are the people you work with and the potential they hold.

But in the hustle of daily work, it’s easy to focus mostly on what’s produced and not on who’s producing it. **The result: People feel they’re interchangeable, and fail to feel engaged or to grow and thrive.**

But when team members feel responsible for their work and valued as individuals, good things happen: Engagement, productivity, and profits rise. People take risks and make breakthroughs.

To begin to empower your team members, take steps to learn who they are as individuals.

> Assume every person you work with has more talent, skill, and ambition than you currently realize.

To get to know your team members better, ask if they feel comfortable sharing more about themselves:

Ask key questions

- What are your goals right now?
- What would you like to learn or try?
- What did you do before this role?
- What are your unsung talents?
- What’s new in your world?

Observe and note

- How team members approach their work
- What they value
- What delights them
- What they need from you
- Where their strengths lie
- Where they could grow


Bond

- Ask about weekend and vacation activities
- Share lighthearted moments
- Follow up on mutual interests
- Invite them for an informal chat
- Brainstorm ideas
- Volunteer together

#### Tip
Share your time equally. Rotate an invitation to coffee—either virtual or in person—so everyone gets a chance.

Be warm but not intrusive. It’s okay if people prefer to keep their personal lives private.


You should _always_ be learning more about your team members. **The better you know people as individuals, the better you’ll perform as a leader.**

That’s because you’ll be delegating work and making decisions based on insight, not on assumptions or stereotypes.

Even if you think you know someone well, make a point of continuously discovering more about them. Here are some questions you can ask:


#### For newer employees
“What life experiences do you have that aren’t on your resume?”
“What are you most eager to do in this role?”
#### For long-time employees

“How are your goals, interests, and skills shifting?”
“What’s new in your world?”

#### For temporary employees

“What else have you done professionally?”
“What would you like to learn or try in this assignment?”


By asking thoughtful questions like these, you’re also helping your team members reflect and gain insight about their own strengths, interests, and professional goals.


## Sam gets to know her team member better

In casual conversation, Sam learns that Padma, a junior member of her team, tutors teens on the weekends. Because the organization is looking for ways to connect with younger customers, Sam nominates Padma for a cross-functional group that’s beginning research into new products and audiences.

## Tip

For remote team members, schedule check-ins to see how they are faring in and out of work. Be curious about what’s happening in their communities, particularly if they live in different cities or countries than you do.


## Take a Moment

What will you do to get to know your team members better?



## Make everyone feel welcome 
* “Why Inclusive Leaders Are Good for Organizations, and How to Become One,” by Juliet Bourke and Andrea Titus. _Harvard Business Review_, March 29, 2019._

**As a leader, you set the tone on fairness and equality.**

According to research, a leader’s words and actions are _the_ determining influence on whether an individual feels included at work. * _“The Key to Inclusive Leadership,” by Juliet Bourke and Andrea Titus. _Harvard Business Review_, March 6, 2020._

Your team members will carefully watch how you treat people.

> A lack of inclusion hurts everyone, while an inclusive environment propels success.

Your job is to make sure each team member feels:

* Respected and treated fairly
* Able to be candid
* Kept up to date on key information
* Given opportunities to grow

Can you guess what percentage of leaders know how inclusive they are (as measured by how inclusive others find them to be)?*

About a third of leaders
**Correct! In a study, 1 in 3 leaders accurately estimated how inclusive they were.** The other two-thirds equally overestimated or underestimated their level of inclusivity.

As a leader, you must reckon with your own biases. **We _all_ have preconceptions that affect how we see others.**

Two common biases are:

* Affinity bias
People instinctively trust people they think are like them and distrust those they perceive to be different.

* Confirmation bias

People focus on information that supports their initial judgments or instincts and ignore contradictory evidence.


When affinity bias combines with confirmation bias, it creates environments in which only certain people thrive.

How does this happen?

- **Affinity bias stacks the deck—**affecting whom you give stretch assignments to, who gets the benefit of the doubt, and whom you coach closely.
- **Confirmation bias compounds the problem,** because it causes you to focus on the strengths of those you innately favor. Thus, the people who already get more support also receive more credit for what they achieve.

And the opposite is true too—you may feel less comfortable with a coworker, spend less time teaching and coaching them, and then judge their output more critically.

That causes your organization to miss out on talent and opportunity. **But more critically, it also means you’re perpetuating inequality and injustice.**

> Being aware of how innate bias works is powerful.

It gives you the chance to consciously make better choices.


Think about the team members you feel less naturally connected to and why that may be. Ask, “Am I giving this person a fair shot? How can I get to know them better?”

Television producer Mia Olufemi shares why she believes every team member should have the chance to contribute in team meetings.

> So recently, I was in a story brainstorm for the new show I'm working on called "Alma's Way." It was created by Sonia Manzano about a little Puerto Rican girl growing up in the Bronx, and it taught me something really important, which is that when you're building a team, it's important to be as inclusive as possible, and that doesn't just mean from a race and cultural perspective. 
Well, there are a lot of voices in this brainstorm meeting. People are talking back and forth, tossing in ideas, and while we were all at a fever pitch, I did notice that there was one member of the team who hadn't yet said something, and that was my production assistant. So traditionally production assistants don't speak much in these meetings. They're really there to take notes, but because of the type of team we are and the type of show we're in, I felt that it was really important to make sure we heard from every member of the team, and I remembered a story that she had told me about working with a child who wasn't comfortable sharing their ideas and how she was able to reach that child through drawings, and it was really important to me that she be the one to tell that story and that I not tell it for her. 
So, she was able to do so and it sparked a ton of great brainstorming ideas that we wouldn't have heard had I not asked her or allowed her the space to speak up and tell us. So, my production assistant's personal experience set off an onslaught of story brainstorming from which I think we'll have five scripts.  
It's really important when creating a team that you make sure you are creating a safe space for everyone to be able to share their personal experiences. It's about who is a part of your team and allowing your team members every opportunity to share. Talking to them, getting to know who they are, and creating those spaces for them to feel comfortable in and share in.


## Make a Plan
What one or two practices will you adopt to make all team members feel welcome?

Lead by example when comunicating , listen, ask


## Create psychological safety _*
You Might Not Be Hearing Your Team’s Best Ideas,” by Michael Parke and Elad N. Sherf. _Harvard Business Review_, June 4, 2020._

Empowered teams speak up—to share tough news, risk asking what may seem like dumb questions, or toss out bold suggestions. They feel safe challenging prevailing wisdom.

**It may look messy at times, but by being candid with each other, these groups are able to move efficiently to make changes or seize opportunities.**

Once again, you—the leader—set the tone by creating a sense of safety.

> Be respectful, civil, and engaged in all your interactions. Insist that all team members display the same decency.

The group’s well-being depends on you! If you see any of these undermining behaviors, address them:

- Scoffing at others’ suggestions
- Taking credit for others’ ideas
- Texting others or having side conversations during meetings
- Interrupting
- Giving patronizing, unsolicited advice

You can do it in the moment: “Dave, you’re reiterating what Andrea suggested. I’m glad you agree. What else can you add?”

Or privately point out the behavior and its impact: “Take care not to interrupt other members of the team before they’ve fully finished making suggestions. We need to hear from everyone.”

Avoid shaming people when you give feedback; instead, use neutral language to make them aware of their behaviors and the effect those actions have.

Here’s how to create a sense of safety so people feel able to speak up:



#### Express curiosity, not judgement

Model asking an open-ended question rather than firing back a reaction. For example, “How would we recoup the investment?” versus “That’s way too expensive.”

#### Separate ideas from implementation 
Encourage people to suggest ideas without then being assigned to execute them or own the results.

#### Assign a dissenter
Publicly ask a team member to look for flaws in an idea or plan. Because this person is assigned to be a naysayer, you’ll get effective troubleshooting without a sense of personal attack. Rotate this role equally through the team.

#### Explain your thinking
Share the rationale behind your decisions and choices. Make sure people understand why you ultimately did or didn’t act on some ideas.

**Safety doesn’t equal harmony.** In fact, you might actually see _more_ disagreement and emotion when people feel safe to challenge you or each other.

That’s okay! Constructive disagreement helps groups refine ideas and come up with effective solutions to challenges.


## Provide growth opportunities 
#book _* Take Ownership of Your Future Self,” by Benjamin Hardy. _Harvard Business Review_, August 28, 2020._

Empower your team members to develop—and even outgrow their roles on your team. You’ll not only help them and the organization—but also yourself.

Entrepreneur and author Christopher Yeh explains how, if you become known as someone who can deliver results _and_ develop talent, your career will flourish.


> Every manager develops a reputation. What's yours?
> Are you the kind of person that people in your organization want to work for, or are you the kind of person that people in your organization want to avoid? Now, hopefully, it's the former. But why would you have a reputation like that? 
> Well, it's not just because of your personality, although I'm sure you're a fun person to work with. The reason managers get a great reputation within their organization among employees is their ability to help those employees progress along their long-term career goals. 
So think about it: If you were in an organization and you were choosing between managers, who would you want to work for—the manager who gave you opportunities to learn and grow, who is consistently producing people within the organization that went on to bigger and better things? Or the manager who held onto all their employees, who managed to deliver numbers year in and year out but whose employees stayed there forever? 
By giving them permission to look at their long-term career future, not just the short-term and the time with you, it allows you to structure their time such that not only does it help meet the business objectives of the company, but it also fits into their long-term career plan. And when you have that kind of mutual relationship where both parties trust each other and both parties are benefiting, you have a much stronger relationship with the direct reports. 
And as they progress with you, they're doing bigger and better things. They're driving more business results. That's good for the employee. That's good for the company. And that's good for you as a manager. 
Ultimately, while you're judged on your results, delivering the numbers, you're also judged on your ability to develop your people. And when you develop the reputation of a manager who's able to take the raw talent, refine it, make it more powerful, and build the talent level of your organization, you're going to be able to attract the best people in the organization to work for you. You're going to accomplish more things for the business. And, ultimately, you'll be more valuable to your company. 


### How can you develop your team?
#### Help them identify clear, motivating goals
Support them in developing a clear, desired _outcome_, the _belief_ that they can succeed, and a _path_ to get there. * _Adapted from “Take Ownership of Your Future Self,” by Benjamin Hardy. _Harvard Business Review_, August 28, 2020._

#### Nudge them into a learning mindset
Ask, “What have you done since we last talked, and what did you learn from it?” Research has shown that asking these coaching questions causes employees to develop new skills faster. * _“6 Ways a Crisis Can Help You Cultivate a Growth Mindset,” by Susan J. Ashford, Maxim Sytch, and Lindred L. Greer. _Harvard Business Review_, August 20, 2020._

#### Catch them doing something right
Give specifics on what they did well and the impact it had. Praise makes people feel safe and valued.

## Make a Plan

Which of these three strategies will you try first with your team? How will you do it?

**As a leader, set a positive tone—one that says to all team members, _“You’re seen and welcomed here.”_**

That’s how you get people fully engaged in their work—and how the group as a whole thrives.


## 30-Second Takeaway

- **Your greatest resources** are the people you work with and the potential they hold.
- When **people feel empowered and valued,** engagement, productivity, and profits rise.
- Delegate work **based on insights about your team members as individuals, not on stereotypes or assumptions.**
- **As a leader, you set the tone on fairness and equality.** A lack of inclusion hurts everyone, while an inclusive environment propels success.
- **Be respectful, civil, and engaged** in all your interactions—and insist that team members display the same decency.
- Help people **develop their skills by identifying motivating goals, coaching, and using praise.**

## The challenges for dispersed teams

How often is your whole team all together in the same workspace? If you’re like more and more leaders, the answer may range from “seldom” to “never.”

#### Dispersed team
A “dispersed team” is any group with team members working from different locations during a workday. That includes:

- Team members who work in different branch offices
- Hybrid teams with some members together in the workplace and others working remotely
- Cross-functional teams based in different countries
- Teams with shift workers who work varying hours
- Teams that are entirely remote and have no physical office

**Dispersed teams bring together talent who would not be able to collaborate without technology.** However, for all their advantages, dispersed teams face challenges. You’ve likely experienced a few of those firsthand.


### Take a Moment

Which hurdles have you faced in leading or being a member of a dispersed team?

- Connection: Feeling like we’re truly part of a shared effort
- Trust: Knowing team members are working hard even if you can’t see them
- Communication: Making sure we share information and don’t get our signals crossed
- Time: Managing workflow and protecting personal boundaries


The good news: According to Harvard Business School professor Tsedal Neeley, virtual teams can be “completely equal to co-located ones in terms of trust and collaboration.” * _“15 Questions About Remote Work, Answered,” by Tsedal Neeley. _Harvard Business Review_, March 16, 2020._

**That means, as a leader, you can let go of any doubt you have about a dispersed team’s ability to be effective.** Embrace the idea that:

Results matter, not physical presence or visible effort

Technology will allow us to collaborate and bond

No matter where or how your team members work, they can thrive—and you can help them do it.

Here, leadership development and diversity consultant Jason Wong offers tips for making your team more inclusive and productive.

> Something that I come back to over and over again, as someone who really spends a lot of time making space and creating teams where groups can really survive and thrive, is that inclusive management practices are high performing management practices. And teams these days look a lot different than teams looked five years ago, right? They are dispersed across time zones, geographies, cultural boundaries, and while we have teams that span these time zones, you really benefit from establishing the scaffolding and framework to help people understand the ways in which they can work together. 
So, for example, something I think about is when someone on your team has a technical problem, what is the approved way of finding help when there isn't a formal way of asking for help? People don't know if they can ask for help, right? People don't know if they should ask for help, and so they just don't, and they get stuck. So formalizing help seeking is super important. 
The second one is repairing misunderstandings, right? We work in a world where most of our communication happens over text. And so, our probability of misunderstanding is greatly increased. And so, are there well-established norms of, hey, this conversation is getting out of control? Let's hop onto a Zoom call and not only that: how do we change our mindset to embrace different opinions and embrace disagreement so that we can synthesize those things into better solutions in the long run? 
And the last thing that I think is super important is what happens when someone makes a mistake? What happens when I make a mistake? Can I show up and be honest and say, “Hey, I messed up, and I'm sorry, right?” Can I model that behavior so that other people in my teams can feel safe in doing that as well?  
The ability for us to talk about our mistakes openly really comes from the leader of the team. If you can't do it yourself, then chances are your reports, and your employees, will be reluctant to do it as well. So, with these three practices in mind not only will you have a more inclusive team, but you'll also have a more productive team. 



## Get everyone on the same page

Your first job is to unify your team and find common purpose among members who may speak different languages, live in different cities or countries, or have different work styles.

> To get people feeling that they’re part of a whole, identify your team’s values—the “who we are” and “how we operate.”

For example, one of your shared values might be “respect.” Another could be “continual learning.” No matter what you choose, be sure everyone has a mutual understanding of the values and how they shape their day-to-day work experience.

**If you asked each member of your team to list your values, would common elements emerge?**

If not, lead your team in identifying 4 to 6 values that drive the work you do. Ask people to consider these questions independently, before discussing their thoughts as a group:

- What do we pride ourselves on?
- What are our non-negotiables?
- How can we best represent the organization’s mission?
- What values are important to us?
- Where do we need clearer standards and agreements?
- How do our values align with and support the organization’s values?

**If your team already has a list of values, consider whether you can reword them to make them more memorable.**

For instance, at Fidelity Investments, executives remind each other of the value of timely decision-making through the phrase “Pace over perfection.”

Catchy wording isn’t just for fun. Studies show that specific, memorable values increase group performance more than cliches.* _“Does Articulating Your Corporate Values Matter?” by Charles Galunic. _INSEAD_, July 1, 2015._

## Tip

If your group includes people without a common first language, take extra care to ensure your team’s values are clearly understood.

As a leader, it’s your job to model the team’s values and make sure team members have the time, resources, and support to do things the right way.

Coach and consultant Lily Zheng describes ways leaders can bring their team’s culture and values to life.

> We've always asked leaders to be good stewards of their company's culture, to foster strong teams, and to put into practice ambitious initiatives like diversity, equity, and inclusion in a global setting. Those goals haven't changed, but the working context has. Amid a global pandemic and a new age of remote work, we're seeing teams that are more distributed than ever and managers that are looking for new tools to help them understand this new context. 
When I work with managers, I ask them to focus on a few things to address these challenges. The first is to recognize that individual check-ins are so important right now. Building those relationships with your employees more than a superficial level, truly seeking to understand the issues that they face, the challenges they're experiencing, how they feel about work, how they feel about their lives, is critical to understanding how to keep your team together. It's absolutely essential to check in more frequently with individuals to understand where they're at. 
Beyond just communication, managers also have to think very hard about how it is they operationalize their company's values and culture. As we all know, culture isn't just words on a wall. We don't simply say things like “companies are places in which all employees can be excellent.” These are things that don't resonate with people. What folks need at this point in time is ways to make culture and values lived and felt. They need to have someone embody culture in their interactions with each other. They need to have a manager that can lead by example. 
And next, we're seeing so many companies push for global work like diversity, equity, and inclusion. And so, managers have to become good at becoming translators to take the work from the top, these initiatives, to adapt them to local and regional contexts to allow them to succeed because that's what it takes to get your employees engaged. That's what it takes to make these things relevant. Managers have that responsibility. And it's much harder now than it was before the pandemic. But by keeping these things in mind, you can use this opportunity as a way to strengthen your company's culture, as a way to strengthen your team, and as a way to keep people together in tough times. 


**It's natural for teams to occasionally experience tension in upholding values.** For instance, your organization may value both “speed” and “high quality,” but in some situations one value will have to trump the other.

However, if your team experiences persistent value clashes, take action. Name the gap between what’s said and what’s actually going on.

For instance, “We say we’re a family-oriented company, but our global staff members are getting a lot of pressure to produce responses by 8 AM Eastern time. That means they’re checking messages and responding to issues during dinner hours each night.”

If an important value is only given lip service, it can erode trust and damage morale.

## Create social bonds across distance

Part of your mission is to ensure that each team member feels like an equal contributor to your group. * _“Global Team Leaders Must Deliberately Create ‘Moments’,” by Tsedal Neeley. _Harvard Business Review,_ March 22, 2012._

Here are a few additional ways you can nurture social bonds among team members, if they are comfortable with it:
#### Meet one-to-one
Individual attention helps people feel valued and gives you a clearer picture of how they’re developing. Be curious about the ideas they have, the challenges they’re facing, and so forth.

 #### Share news
 Keep people apprised of organizational strategy, progress updates, client feedback, and key milestones. Build your own internal and industry network so you _can_ keep your team well informed.
#### Find moments for fun
Laughter defuses tension, increases goodwill, and builds resilience. Open your meetings with small talk, and close out projects with celebrations and chances to relax together.
#### Pair up team members
A “buddy system” helps build relationships and can be a powerful learning and productivity tool.

### Tip
If you lead a hybrid team, consider pairing remote workers with in-office buddies to create bonds and ensure each group understands the other’s reality.


## Open communication channels

A team comes to life when members can really talk—ask questions, get help, and offer critiques. In a dispersed team, that may happen more over messaging platforms than in person. * _“15 Questions About Remote Work, Answered,” by Tsedal Neeley. _Harvard Business Review,_ March 16, 2020._

Here, Felicia Jadczak, co-founder of She+ Geeks Out, shares best practices for bringing virtual teams together across the distance.

> When my organization, She Geeks Out, transitioned to be 100% remote and virtual, when COVID-19 first hit us, it wasn't that big of a leap for us because we were already leveraging and using different technology platforms. And so, it was more about leaning into what we were using already. And what we started to do was we added in an extra 30 minutes to the start of every weekly team meeting, and the reason for that extra time was not to talk more about work, but to have some time for what I love to call, "planned spontaneity." We wanted to recreate a little bit of that time where our employees and our team could feel like they could hang out and just chat with each other, and not have to have it be about a specific topic or about what was happening at work. 
One other thing that we did to help augment connections between a team, in this virtual time, was to implement two different check-in questions. And so, it can be something like, “what did you eat for dinner last night?” or “what would your superhero power be if you were a superhero?” Whatever it is, it's a chance for us to break outside of our day-to-day routine a little bit and get to know each other a bit better. 
The second question that we do is we ask, “how can we support each other as a team in the week coming up?” And so, those two questions we found really, really helpful and valuable because it helps connect the team, give that sense of togetherness and camaraderie, and also replicates, in a sense, those mini interactions that we would have had in person, which we weren't able to have anymore. So, with social unrest, with COVID, with a lot of just generalized stress and anxiety, we wanted to make sure that we were carving out some space so that people felt like they could ask for help if they needed it. 


No matter how people connect, how can you ensure communication flows easily on your team? **Investigate how people exchange information and where miscues happen.** Then use the insights to ensure that all team members are on the same page.

For example, you might determine that:

- “We rarely check email on this team, so post important messages to this board.”
- “Banter welcome on the chat thread until about 3 PM New York time, but after that, please keep it business only as we pull together the day’s incident report.”
- “Our templates change often—it’s a running joke that none have lasted more than two weeks— so don’t save anything to your desktop. When you need to use a template, download it again from the shared folder.”

**As your team establishes communication etiquette, specify:**

#### How to make the most collaborative tools
- Information summaries: email
- Socializing and quick project-related comments: team messaging platform
- Nuanced or complex topics: phone or video call, followed by email summary
- Urgent messages: text, call, or messaging platform
#### When the team should be online and offline

Establish a few common “office hours”—overlapping windows of times where people can weigh in on matters quickly.

#### How team members protect personal time
Encourage team members to set their message status to “do not disturb” outside of their workday. If individuals choose to work during off hours, ask them to schedule messages to be delivered during their coworkers’ actual working hours.

#### How the team fixes misunderstandings
Try a two-message rule: If a team member has sent a coworker two messages on the same subject and confusion persists, they should talk.


### Tip
Encourage people to seek clarification before reacting to a message they perceive as critical or burdensome. For instance: _"_It sounds like you want me to___. Did I get that right?" The better the team can get in managing their interactions, the less time you’ll spend refereeing squabbles.


Finally, establish routines for how you communicate to the group:

* Send meeting agendas in advance
* Avoid last-minute changes or cancellations
* Follow up to reinforce key points

Before a meeting with your team, mentally prepare:
- What do you want them to **know?**
-  What do you want them to **do?**
- How do you want them to **feel?**
When you write your agenda, note how long you want to spend on each item, including buffer time for small talk and conversation about any sensitive topics.


## Lead a global team

At their best, global teams are exciting and dynamic, offering members a chance to learn about other parts of the world and build skills for career growth. But if not led well, global teams can be hamstrung by poor communication, inefficiency, and distrust. * _“How to Work Successfully Across Borders,” by Tsedal Neeley. _Harvard Business Review,_ August 14, 2018._

Below are three problems many global teams face—and ideas for how to guide your team in overcoming them.

**Language barriers**

- Slow down the pace of the conversation.
- Use common, simple language—not business jargon and idioms.
- Ask clarifying question when you sense confusion.
- Invite input first from those who tend to speak less.
