## My values

### What do I value?
#### Traits I admire in others?
How easy is for some people to approach humans, because they have reduced a lot their biases, I stil lstruggle with this as sometimes keep myself intimidated by some people.

#### Pay attention to the things i am willing to take stand for
Peace, respect 

#### What makes me feel uneasy = what makes me feel like i'm back in the right path?
Good communication, that someone listens to what I say, and be recognized that what I say matters as well. 
Have self respect for myself as then I can ask for such same respect by others.
Do not let people take or pass my boundaries.
Anger makes me very uneasy, which is a challenge that I need to work on to overcome and deal with in difficult situations.

I value candor, therefore I can integrate it on my set of values, taking difficult subjects and sharing as much business information as I can with my team.

#### Choose a vision to work towards.
My values are my foundation, but I also need direction. I cannot lead people if i do not know where I am going.

So no matter my role nor level, i need a vision, a clear and compelling mental image of a better future to steer toward.

A good vision is aspirational but not far fetched

> Your vision inspires you, focuses your attention on long-term priorities and challenges you to grow as a person.

**A vivid, positive image**

Your vision should be easy to remember and visualize. It should appeal to your head and your heart.

**A tie to the organizational mission**

Your vision should support the parts of your organization's work that are the most relevant and inspiring to you.

**A timeframe**

Your vision should be challenging but achievable. To ensure you've gotten the right balance, choose a goal that you can imagine achieving through clear, manageable steps.


## A better future for my team
I imagine my team or the team  I am leading one which is integrated and able to speak up. My team works productively, shares knowledge and has a good work-life balance.
My team sets some time to gather after working hours to create human connection.
My team knows and accepts each other differences as well as welcome them.
The final goal for my team is work in a sustainable way and efficiency, always focusing in proper software quality, my team aims to be a leading example for the rest of the company.


## My team plan

I envision myself as a supportive leader who respects and accepts people's differences and needs, with willingness to share experiences and moments. I stand strict to my values and accept beforehand that there will be conflicts and situations in which I will be questioned. Sticking to my values (loyalty, respect, attention, candor, listening, love, discipline and professionalism) I should be able to stand for myself and my team.


### Set a direction for my team
#### Capture people's imagination
Help them see the “better future” and its possibilities as clearly as you do. 

**Do:** Make your point memorable by telling a story, giving a demonstration, or sharing a compelling photograph.

**Don’t:** Use stiff language, a lot of jargon, or heaps of data.


#### Explain "why"

Convey the reasons the effort is important.

**Do:** Spell out how this work benefits members of your team as individuals. What do they _personally_ stand to gain?

**Don’t:** Assume the “why” is obvious. Get feedback in advance from someone outside your team to make sure your vision is clear, compelling, and logical.


#### Seek ideas on “how”
Give the team a stake in this endeavor. Ask, “How could we make this happen?” and “What obstacles might we encounter?”

**Do:** Get team members engaged and curious. Frame next steps as a collaborative act.

**Don’t:** Reel off a detailed series of instructions.

To accomplish your vision, talk about it often, carve out time to push toward the goal, and gather feedback on progress.



### Making a plan
I have a vision towards the need to create more human connections in a hyperconnected-hyper isolated- hyper individual world, where being in touch with each other and being able to talk and express our fears will enable to regain trust and connection. I envision a way in which we can overcome the challenges that technology progress, global warming and wars are putting upon us. Then I will try to share my knowledge, experiences and personal life learnings, as I will be able to provide guidance. Discipline will be key to achieve goals and sustainability will enable my team to openly speak when something does not feel right. By reminding that we will all have the possiblitiy to speak openly and be listened. Every one's idea matters, importance to listen and be present.

## Lead without formal authority

> Informal leadership takes many forms

For instance, a person starts listening carefully, framing key issues, sharing information, and moving a group to consensus. Or someone invites team members who are generally silent during meetings to contribute their perspectives.

Here, leadership researcher Anne Morriss describes what informal leaders do and how they benefit their teams, their organizations—and their own careers.

Informal authority gets rewarded with formal authority.

### Listen more than you talk

There is a myth that leaders need to speak powerfully. But studies show that groups perceive people who _listen to others_ as more credible. Be attentive, ask perceptive questions, and summarize the key points of what you’ve learned.

### Provide clarity
Share information widely, quickly, and accurately. Identify the various options and trade-offs in a complex situation so the team can make good choices about how to move forward.

### Stay calm
Make a point of staying steady—especially when others are getting frustrated or anxious—and of acknowledging everyone's concerns.

### Keep yourself honest
Focus on the best outcome for everyone. If people suspect you're operating based on self-interest or a hidden agenda, they won't follow your lead for long.


Finally, choose your moments for informal leadership wisely. Step up to lead when you are:

- Passionate about the issue
- Aware of challenges or opportunities and have constructive ideas on how to help
- Trusted by the parties involved
- Armed with specific and relevant knowledge or experience
- Sincere in your desire to help
