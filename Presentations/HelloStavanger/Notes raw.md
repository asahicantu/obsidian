# Proof of humanity
A new approach to a world dominated by tech-ai
# Disclaimier
The following notes are a set of self reflections and my aim to bring/contribute with questions and toughts which might help us humans to challenge our status quo, bring into our attention span situations that are happening in our world, circle of concern and potentially contribute to surf the coming wave of post tech ai

# I will try to
encourage you to resignify the concept of 
intelligence
dependece
humanity

## H2.0
in the past...

It seems it was easier to anthropomorphize natural phenomenons

now they have a scientific explanation, 
and little by little we aproach to an all-known, all accurate corpus of knowledge


---
We have the power to choose how we create solution for the current world problems
probably more than we realize

I believe it is more important to look at each other now, to avoid repeating the mistakes that as a world we are currently suffering. 
If we had time, we could have done things differently

## Lost connections

## Renaming
Artifitial
Alien

Intelligence

## Is AI able to think / reflect / self-consciousness/feel

## Redesign the  concept of being human in a modern society
## Intro
Everything is information

## What have changed
Jobs are not the same
Truth is not the same
Power if nor hte same
purpose is not the same

## As for mid 2024...
AI had outsmarted the smartest PHD genral knowledge


## In search of human connection

Loneliness is expensive

## Redesign
### Purpose of life
## What is real?
It no longer matters

If it makes you feel or behave or affect you in certain way, then it is real for you because it is happening inside you
Our physical 
reality

## In search for human connection
"Human connection"




## Difference between

Significant and meaning
What do these words trigge in your feelings?

Love
Greed
War
Peace

## The words that I tend to repeat to myself
... And i am still nowhere near/..

The only experience you have is here and now


## The trend is..
It becomes malpractice not to use AI/copilots

## Who am I?




What do i have as a skill 
That AI WIl not?

What am I then?

## Was it really necessary?


Is it really necessary

Emergence
Generalize
Reason 
Create

Predict outcomes
Generate novel responses


## Responsible technology is a journey
... And so far we have fucked up

Responisble AI is a journey

### So let's go home together
## The end of non-repudation
I can see the time where it might be necessary to show one self in person

## I am,..

Tyring to redefine the work I do and my purpose in life
The work I do and my purpose in life

## Synthetic


## What is

AI is becoming smart enough that we do not have humans smart enough to test how smart it actually is



20-39 years education system



My goal for this presentation is to bring our current situation to the circle of concern, 
For evey time you think on 
Try to birng communities


May you be happy
May you be strong
May you feel like you belong
___


Although we may globally agree with a common abstract concept they trigger in us different spark of feelings based on our past experience and living stories, information we have consumed, even foor and people/education we have had

It is therefore for that reason why we find it so difficutl to communicate and express and acknowledge why certain gesture or tratment from one another may feel different among humans.

Importance fo listening, being present, and retake action

The power to select our habits, the information we consume

Does it really matter how intelligent we are_ we will be?
Do we discriminate beacuse of that?
How are we supposed to deal with what is coming
How can we reinvent new financial/economic/societal systems that allow us to deconstruct societies

## What is coming
Our reactions and interpetation of reality highly depends on the future we are shaping
Things will just happen faster and faster

## Information Overflow
No way to hyper consume

## Norway has a way...

## Innovate in
Fiarness reliability privacy inclusiveness transaptrency accountability

## The dark forest of the internet
The dark forest of the internet

## Entering into a new era of abundance

## So what makes us human?
We want to be happy
we want to love and be loved

>A species that is capable of love is divine
    Mo gawdat
>
___

I can look myself at the mirror
I feel
I am organic
I make mistakes (lots of)
Some day I will die
I am biased
I am wrong
I sleep
I get tired
## We are breaking down
for excitement excess
misuse of words

## The choices we make every day
____
# Redefinition to avoid our present mistakes
War
Deshumanization

___

# Deshumanization
The horrors we commit to our selves at this degree  of collective knowledge/consciousness will come back harder to oursleves

Think of the meaning of these words
War
Fear
Terror

# My Last Five Years of Work
>â€œI am 25. These next five years might be the last few years that I work. I am not ill, nor am I becoming a stay-at-home mom, nor have I been so financially fortunate to be on the brink of voluntary retirement. I stand at the edge of a technological development that seems likely, should it arrive, to end employment as I know it.

These were the words of one of the top AI researchers at anthropic in May 2024, few days after Chat GPT-4o was deployed. 

Presentations like this tend to age fast, and bad. The amount of people talking on this topic with apocaliptic/concerning results is astonishing.
Meanwhile the researches, discoveries and inovations in this fieald do not cease to amaze me.
I have reached the point in which I begin to imagin how impossible the world without AI will be.

I can also imagine at the same time how the old days and days were digitalization was not so present may come back eventyally

My goal for this talk is to expose my thoughts as a story, try to dive into this words and worlds with a different perspective


## The reality of the world

In the beginning there was the word


Image/ video used to be the constant (As something verifiable and taken by truth)
I am in my late 30's I grew with the massification of computers and internet while we still needed a modem connected to the telephone line.

## Invasion of synthetic data
All the knowledge of the word has already been uploaded into the internet
That alone is no

Simulations, digital twinds, 3-D worlds emulating our behaviour, our physics, our way of thinking
So whether it is real or not no longer matters as we are redefining the new meaning of being real.



On friday 13th 2024 Chatgpt 01 PHD level, capable of reasoning, and yet we are not close to AGI


## Redefinitions
Researchers are intending now to rename, give a new meaning to the acronym AI. As for now of artifitial has no longer relevange. It is not artificial, on the contrary, it is very real and a constant, as a developer it is becoming irreplazable and valuable for our daily job
AI = Alien | Augmented Intelligence


This is not intended to be a pessimistic speech, it is relevant that we intend now to be more human approachable, create and engage in communities. 

  We already fail with social media for our lack of knowledge on how our brain works.
  New generations are developing dependency and addiction to not only digital content, but also to synthetic conversations, videogames, and little by little simulations become a cheaper more comfortable way to live a life rather than the one actually known.


Where is this taking us in a capitalist world were leaders insist on making wars were global warming demands prompt advances solutions for our complex problems. And yet.. the application of AI does not seem to meet our final requirements as humanity.

I believe we have the power to change same as we have the power to lift / clean our own shit.
Acknowledge our mistakes, welcome the failure and be open to change of opinion, 

Use the technology, educate yourself and your families, talk about it with your colleagues, your concerns matter and deserve to be listened in forums like this one. 


Image polution image internet contamination



The words do not come up yet, i feel that i have so much to say bur i keep thinking and thinking without getting somewhere
would it be because i thinkg in different languages. i do not feel capable of myself or i am simply exhausted with so many thoughts on my own?

Whatever the sitatuion is I try to find answers fro this presentation but at the same time I cannot. it is like my emotions problems and the conflicts with my wife little by little steal and eat space in my mind, drain mye motions and imprison me to a point it makes it really difficult to begint to operate/coordinate ideas and have better self control/

feeling energetic and with a good lever of energy helps to better have control over my feelings, like if it was always a boiling pot willing to emerge but being cold from time to time, which help diminisht he feelings of anger, remorse, regret, rage, sadness.

problems is what makes me human
feeling
seeing a reality?


How do psychologicla problems emerge

A wolrd dominated by algorithms
Alogrithms controlling what we snould see, think, say, feel

it is likely that we feel ashamed for our overusage of social media in the same way smoking and drinking / lead paint/ radioactive toys are now outrageous and impossible to be

it seems we have learned from our mistakes, and yet....

i feel so focking baddedededede
disspaointned tired, without any spirit fo salvation

salvation
salvation
frustration
forever, eber


what is this iever
ig i ever have i ever
ehat is this
what id this
what is this

who aom i
what am i
when is i tgioing to stiop\22


lets not loose the ability to talk to each other
reasonale conversation are breaking down when we need them the most
with the most advanced technology at hte moment
information is not truth
we are overflodded
we do not have more knowledge nor wisdom
it is rather becoming scarce



# My Speech

Hello everyone, 

Thank you so much for taking part of your time and give me  your attention for the next 30 minutes,
I will try to hold your attention for the next 30 minutes and if I cannot succeed on my attempt I offer my apologies. Really wanted to be at the stage at this day for the things that I want to share and normally talk about among my friends and colleagues. 

Let me tell you that before the Generative AI and agents hype I was already keen and concern for the speed at which technology evolves and change our lives; and the little time we have to adapt, understand and digest the information we consume, the cultural transformation and the impact on societies.

I hope then this topic results as interesting as it is for me and I can contribute to grab your attention into matters like this to make us believe that we do have the power for
* well being,
* deconstruction
* transformation
* re-definition
### (Disclaimer goes here)

But first let me warn you that some of these ideas are a compilation of many writers, researchers and youtubers. All of which resonated on me and let me to share my perspective of our present and future. Arguments like this are based on my own opinion and I invite you to let yourselves feel the uncomfortability of such topics if so. Just please hold your tomatoes.

Before I start please let me raise a samll survey here
How many of you were not born in Norway ? ok, you can thank you//

---- 
Look at this space.. I like the initiative were people interested in those topics have the opportunity to gather, talk and help themselves in those matters
# Human redefinition
What is a human?

Not so long time ago it was a matter of religion to give us a meaning
Things began to tremble as science developed and told us we were no longer sons of good but a gradual evolution of apes capable of thiking, reflecting, using its vocal cords for language and telling stories.

I think back in those days it was easy to fit into a certain social class, religious group, and our tasks/ time would be more mundane.

With the arrival of capitalism and industrial revolution the concept of human transformed into automata, en extension for a machine, a worker an labor capable of operating and transforming / terraforming our world, 


How would you define a human now?
How would you define yourselves

I think and think and for most of the time the words that try to distringuish and classify me as something different from other species rely on:

Biological organism with 4 main extremities, able to talk, see, smell, hear, listen,  think, reflect, AND FEEL

Technology is little by little dismembering us from the qualities that previously would define us, displacing us from being the center of the universe to more than 8 billion individuals with their own opinion, perspective and reality.


What is reality?

Does it really matter now if something that you see is or not?
Because if it feels like to you or is able to change your feelings, affect the way you think, then it no longer matters.

And that is is the reason of my concern. 
I do not know how technological development will lead us to transform into something that will need to be re-defined.

Emergence phenommenon

The possibility that in 3 years we may no longer have to work or trade our time for money


The potential we have to deconstruct ourselves and come back to our roots while at the same time accept technological development as and extension and a tool to outperform.

The dangers of creating synthetic information make it impossible for a single individual to digest, understand and communicate at the speed at which AI agents do it now.

I fear for the time that internet dies for human beings, information becomes so vast that makes is extremely hard for users to sail around it.






I will try not to bombard you with all the things that 


It happens to me know, that i have free time, possiblity to browse the internet, and feel already numb, fool of "cookie " , a youtube video "and have to watch two commercials", a spotify paid subscription and still have to listen to something i did not ask for, a reddit account and still have to scroll up over advertisements every five posts. I check my email and even there i have once more advertisements.

Internet feels like empty to me, even it is  paradoxicaly becoming bigger and bigger

Bit activity is probably more that 80%

## Your synthetic "you"


DO you think "everything" will be AI generated?
Is it time to move out? Create a new internet?
IF so it means that will be the place of all the living AI agents

"You do not realize it but you are being programmed"

Victim of the multiplier effect

"When was the last time you read a book"?

"Hello... is there anybody in there?"

"Gen AI is the nuclear bomb of information age"

# The end?
Transformation

W

## The reverse turing test

Surveillance

Amazon


Ensurification

How to leave, when to leave?

Feels to me that I am stuck

## TRUST


## Can humans be quantifieable?

Defined into an equation?

Enclosed in a box in a tiny moment of a time that an algorithm decides and yet....
Do we know who we are?
Do we know ourselves better than machines?



### NOTES

1. Good morning everyone, before I begin I would like to thank the person or people who had to evaluate my proposal for speech, approve it and validate it. Then I will have the opportunity to share with you for 30 minutes some of my visions and concerns for the society/state-of-the-art technlodogy. 
2. Secondly, i want to thank you for giving mi a chance to be in front of you and hopefully challenge you with a new set of ideas, concept and perspectives about the global s ociety we are becoming now.
3. And last, this content was created without any Gen-AI tool and are my complete reflection, sources extration over my research.
4. 
5. So lets begind, my name is Asahi Cantu, I work at capgemini as a senior program engineer, many of my interests and hobbies are tech related, such as blockchain, ai, software, cybersecurity, among others.
6. (Why PoH) Why proof of humanyt?
	1. I deceided to name my talk like that for the following reasons:
	2. PoW ] See, when bitcoin and blockchain paper was issued in 2008 the algorithm highlighted to allow an entity to inject information into the blockchain was by coming to a solution to a complex computational problem called Proof of Work. Basically the machine had to spent enormous amount of power to find a seed alphanumeric that hased gives the result of 0x0000000XXXXXX or vicwversa, is basically high speed brute forcing to come to a result.
	3. Therefore and because it seems to me that now we have to perform certain way of work, approvakm 
7. DISCLAIMERS
	1. These are my opinions and based on my on research and realities
	2. This presentation-talk is already obsolete
	3. (WHAT WAS MY THIRD ONE?)
8. Reudctionism, manipulation
9. We are indeed at the edge of a singularity moment
10. Waiting for the black swan, or the miracle that AI promises to provides to us
	1. Yet, we fail to realize that mos of this development originated by companies who make profit from the time - emotions. opinions, feelings we develope accrsoss them,
	2. And even one of the greates inventions in the decade (Chat GPT) comes from a company that claimed to be open and provide AI solutions for society in an attempt to countermeasure the dark technological development
11. So what makes me human?
12. My Last Five Years of Work
>â€œI am 25. These next five years might be the last few years that I work. I am not ill, nor am I becoming a stay-at-home mom, nor have I been so financially fortunate to be on the brink of voluntary retirement. I stand at the edge of a technological development that seems likely, should it arrive, to end employment as I know it.

![[QR_AviyalBalwitB.png]]

These were the words of one of the top AI researchers at anthropic in May 2024, few days after Chat GPT-4o was deployed. 
We are indeed
11. The dead internet - The dark forest
	1. I have witnessed the transition of internet from the asdl modem that used to make funny noises, from webpages such as myspace, msn messenger, to nowadays
	2. Paradoxically I believe I was among you one of the few lucky generations who saw the internet grow and become what it is now today.
	3. If you are not in technology and have parents, maybe they struggle with such development and you have to help them configure or browse pages, maybe the technological tools they know how to use are a web browser and a faceboor messenger, instagram snapchat or whatsapp
	4. On the other hand, if you are a centenial or younger generation and you are not involved in technology, probably you are as techa gnositc as our parents-grandparents but you are skilled in the world that social media provides, every single step further and further from the knowledge and information that builds the roots of the digital society.
	5. The result, a digital analphabetism
	6. Our attentions span
		1. When was the last time you read a book? a news paper? a magazine? an article?
		2. When was the last time you could gather with friends and discuss certain sensitive topic without looking at your mobile?
	7. It feels to me that we let that 
	8. Internet iceberg, up to 90% of all social content is "inaccessible " to us
	9. Think that modern language models have been trained with such information, and even if they do not show or advertise what is hidden, the recipe on how to create them is already public, and allwhat you need is now the corpus of these web pages and computational resources in order to get there.
	10. Think about this:
		1. How many differetn sources of information - web pages, newspapers, video platforms, etc do you browse in a week?
		2. How many of those run under big corporations (non public content)
		3. How many of those project advertisements to you?
		4. How many of these websites are telling you that they are intentionally trakcing every step you make in order to get information from you that you do not even know you are sharing just because you do not want to read a whole legal paper telling you what will happen during your user experience and then what they will do with such information, anyways i already agree...
		5. It feels empty to me, i do no know where to go, or what to browse, i can be stuck to hours of content in a censored youtube who already knows my taste and preferences so it always keeps showing me the data and making me feel safe, that the world agrees with my opinions and that i am right. There are no experiences anymore.
		6. Sadly it is becoming less and less, feels more plastic and makes me tired every time i see a Gen-AI image, at least now i can distinguis, one month later I will not, Which means I will not be able to rationally trust this
		7. iT FEELS  EMPTY, tha information is repeating over and over...
	11. IN THE BEGNINNING THERE WAS THE WORD.... 
	12. Whether I like it or not, I h
	

12. It is no longer a platform in which we can share and discuss or read and put knowledge-information to the masses
	1. 
13. There is no time to wait, dont read, skip terms and conditions, keep scrolling, keep watching...
14. My brain is exhausted, to me that is enough
15. Generative content
16. Time to say goodbye
17. Time to deconstruct 
	1. take what you love - liked the most
	2. Try to move away from such platforms, to build back something better, for us
18. So what it feels to be human
19. What I am trying to tell you is that I, you we as a community have a tremendous power, because we know part of the building blocks that form all this conglomerate of tech-digital superstructure. With every piece of knowledge or agent or code you put into this universe you are building the future of the new society. how do you want it to be? what kind of moral, ethic, religious, human thoughts come to you when you develop such technologies. What do you believe are your weaknesses and fears as a person that may end up shaping your behaviour, the way you work, your interactions as an employee, member of this community?
20. I still remember the first time I experienced true loneliness, it was 7 years ago in October the 2nd, When I came for the first time to Stavanger in a rainy sunday. From mexico.
21. DO NOT IGNORE YOUR INSTINCT. TRY TO HELP, DROP A HAND, A SMILE, SOME HELP TO WHOMEVER YOU CAN
22.  We all integrate an atom and element of this great fabric tha tI like to call it "the lattice", and like stones in water, our actions good or bad create wavews, impact and affect people in ways that we do not imagine
23. Think on the multiplier effect and second-third degree of consequences effect
24. Our actions have great consequences, whether we like them or not.
25. Time to redefine who we are, important for our future in which yes, we will be displaced in certain areas of our human world that onece believed make us part of who we are?
26. So what is next, what can help us redefine and keep going so we can build better societis, 
27. We as humanity have been there before, when suddenly we have scientific discoveries that told us we are no longer the center of the universe, the solar system, nor a divine creation, and now we are not the only species in this world able to think and rationate, 
28. Will be the only ones to "feel" , in a reality that already denies other species than ours to feel and have emotions?

### .... And how much money are you worth?

29. With these final words I will fnish with my own definition, what is helping me surf and traverse these difficult challenging times...
30. What is being human?
	1. Is a sunny day, brething fresh air, the taste of the water, the lost of a loved one, the feeling that everything is collapsing, the fear for the future, the guilt and regret of the past, being human is feeling lost, the touch of a hand, the warm of a hug. The tears in my eyes, the pain of life, the joy of the present, and the candle of the hearth that lights in the shine and in the dark, being human is this flow of duality, this inability to know one self, nor know it all, and be ok with it..
	2. Being human is accept the journey, accept that one day I will go, and legacy will traverse bodies, will touch minds, will be this moment trying to do something for good, to be better
	3. Accept my mistakes, dare to live, dare to try again, and again...
	4. Is health and disease, is all these entangled things that let me know that I am finite..
	5. A feel of belonging, the feeling of loneliness. the struggle and the fight, the hope and the faith... Rainbows of feelings, mixture of senses, that this world offers to us to realize, that the only thing we have for certain and for granted, is this very present.
	6. Is more than 8 billion ways of interpreting reality at the same time, every second....
31. I know one day I will have to look at that and redefine it, but as for this present is helping me, is daring me to keep on trying, 
32. Leave traces, leave traces everywhere, leave steps, smiles, kindness, make your voice be heard, your face be shown, your steps be strong, your eyes be looked at... so we can acknoledge your existence and your uniqueness... Irrepetible in this world.
33. May it be that... you dare to jump to life?
34.  May you be happy, may you be strong, may you feel like you belong.....
