# Proof of humanity
A new approach to a world dominated by tech-ai
# Disclaimier
The following notes are a set of self reflections and my aim to bring/contribute with questions and toughts which might help us humans to challenge our status quo, bring into our attention span situations that are happening in our world, circle of concern and potentially contribute to surf the coming wave of post tech ai

## Renaming
Artifitial
Alien

Intelligence

## Is AI able to think / reflect / self-consciousness/feel

## Redesign the  concept of being human in a modern society
## Intro
Everything is information

## What have changed
Jobs are not the same
Truth is not the same
Power if nor hte same
purpose is not the same

## As for mid 2024...
AI had outsmarted the smartest PHD genral knowledge


## In search of human connection

Loneliness is expensive

## Redesign
### Purpose of life
## What is real?
It no longer matters

If it makes you feel or behave or affect you in certain way, then it is real for you because it is happening inside you
Our physical 
reality

## In search for human connection
"Human connection"




## Difference between

Significant and meaning
What do these words trigge in your feelings?

Love
Greed
War
Peace

## The words that I tend to repeat to myself
... And i am still nowhere near/..

The only experience you have is here and now


## The trend is..
It becomes malpractice not to use AI/copilots

## Who am I?




What do i have as a skill 
That AI WIl not?

What am I then?

## Was it really necessary?


Is it really necessary

Emergence
Generalize
Reason 
Create

Predict outcomes
Generate novel responses


## Responsible technology is a journey
... And so far we have fucked up

Responisble AI is a journey

### So let's go home together
## The end of non-repudation
I can see the time where it might be necessary to show one self in person

## I am,..

Tyring to redefine the work I do and my purpose in life
The work I do and my purpose in life

## Synthetic


## What is

AI is becoming smart enough that we do not have humans smart enough to test how smart it actually is



20-39 years education system



My goal for this presentation is to bring our current situation to the circle of concern, 
For evey time you think on 
Try to birng communities


May you be happy
May you be strong
May you feel like you belong
___


Although we may globally agree with a common abstract concept they trigger in us different spark of feelings based on our past experience and living stories, information we have consumed, even foor and people/education we have had

It is therefore for that reason why we find it so difficutl to communicate and express and acknowledge why certain gesture or tratment from one another may feel different among humans.

Importance fo listening, being present, and retake action

The power to select our habits, the information we consume

Does it really matter how intelligent we are_ we will be?
Do we discriminate beacuse of that?
How are we supposed to deal with what is coming
How can we reinvent new financial/economic/societal systems that allow us to deconstruct societies

## What is coming
Our reactions and interpetation of reality highly depends on the future we are shaping
Things will just happen faster and faster

## Information Overflow
No way to hyper consume

## Norway has a way...

## Innovate in
Fiarness reliability privacy inclusiveness transaptrency accountability

## The dark forest of the internet
The dark forest of the internet

## Entering into a new era of abundance

## So what makes us human?
We want to be happy
we want to love and be loved

>A species that is capable of love is divine
