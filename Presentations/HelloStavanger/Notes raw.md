# Proof of humanity
A new approach to a world dominated by tech-ai
# Disclaimier
The following notes are a set of self reflections and my aim to bring/contribute with questions and toughts which might help us humans to challenge our status quo, bring into our attention span situations that are happening in our world, circle of concern and potentially contribute to surf the coming wave of post tech ai

# I will try to
encourage you to resignify the concept of 
intelligence
dependece
humanity

## H2.0
in the past...

It seems it was easier to anthropomorphize natural phenomenons

now they have a scientific explanation, 
and little by little we aproach to an all-known, all accurate corpus of knowledge


---
We have the power to choose how we create solution for the current world problems
probably more than we realize

I believe it is more important to look at each other now, to avoid repeating the mistakes that as a world we are currently suffering. 
If we had time, we could have done things differently

## Lost connections

## Renaming
Artifitial
Alien

Intelligence

## Is AI able to think / reflect / self-consciousness/feel

## Redesign the  concept of being human in a modern society
## Intro
Everything is information

## What have changed
Jobs are not the same
Truth is not the same
Power if nor hte same
purpose is not the same

## As for mid 2024...
AI had outsmarted the smartest PHD genral knowledge


## In search of human connection

Loneliness is expensive

## Redesign
### Purpose of life
## What is real?
It no longer matters

If it makes you feel or behave or affect you in certain way, then it is real for you because it is happening inside you
Our physical 
reality

## In search for human connection
"Human connection"




## Difference between

Significant and meaning
What do these words trigge in your feelings?

Love
Greed
War
Peace

## The words that I tend to repeat to myself
... And i am still nowhere near/..

The only experience you have is here and now


## The trend is..
It becomes malpractice not to use AI/copilots

## Who am I?




What do i have as a skill 
That AI WIl not?

What am I then?

## Was it really necessary?


Is it really necessary

Emergence
Generalize
Reason 
Create

Predict outcomes
Generate novel responses


## Responsible technology is a journey
... And so far we have fucked up

Responisble AI is a journey

### So let's go home together
## The end of non-repudation
I can see the time where it might be necessary to show one self in person

## I am,..

Tyring to redefine the work I do and my purpose in life
The work I do and my purpose in life

## Synthetic


## What is

AI is becoming smart enough that we do not have humans smart enough to test how smart it actually is



20-39 years education system



My goal for this presentation is to bring our current situation to the circle of concern, 
For evey time you think on 
Try to birng communities


May you be happy
May you be strong
May you feel like you belong
___


Although we may globally agree with a common abstract concept they trigger in us different spark of feelings based on our past experience and living stories, information we have consumed, even foor and people/education we have had

It is therefore for that reason why we find it so difficutl to communicate and express and acknowledge why certain gesture or tratment from one another may feel different among humans.

Importance fo listening, being present, and retake action

The power to select our habits, the information we consume

Does it really matter how intelligent we are_ we will be?
Do we discriminate beacuse of that?
How are we supposed to deal with what is coming
How can we reinvent new financial/economic/societal systems that allow us to deconstruct societies

## What is coming
Our reactions and interpetation of reality highly depends on the future we are shaping
Things will just happen faster and faster

## Information Overflow
No way to hyper consume

## Norway has a way...

## Innovate in
Fiarness reliability privacy inclusiveness transaptrency accountability

## The dark forest of the internet
The dark forest of the internet

## Entering into a new era of abundance

## So what makes us human?
We want to be happy
we want to love and be loved

>A species that is capable of love is divine
    Mo gawdat

___

I can look myself at the mirror
I feel
I am organic
I make mistakes (lots of)
Some day I will day
I am biased
I am wrong
I sleep
I get tired
## We are breaking down
for excitement excess
misuse of words

## The choices we make every day
____
# Redefinition to avoid our present mistakes
War
Deshumanization

___

# Deshumanization
The horrors we commit to our selves at this degree  of collective knowledge/consciousness will come back harder to oursleves

Think of the meaning of these words
War
Fear
Terror

# My Last Five Years of Work
>â€œI am 25. These next five years might be the last few years that I work. I am not ill, nor am I becoming a stay-at-home mom, nor have I been so financially fortunate to be on the brink of voluntary retirement. I stand at the edge of a technological development that seems likely, should it arrive, to end employment as I know it.

![[QR_AviyalBalwitB.png]]

These were the words of one of the top AI researchers at anthropic in May 2024, few days after Chat GPT-4o was deployed. 

Presentations like this tend to age fast, and bad. The amount of people talking on this topic with apocaliptic/concerning results is astonishing.
Meanwhile the researches, discoveries and inovations in this fieald do not cease to amaze me.
I have reached the point in which I begin to imagin how impossible the world without AI will be.

I can also imagine at the same time how the old days and days were digitalization was not so present may come back eventyally

My goal for this talk is to expose my thoughts as a story, try to dive into this words and worlds with a different perspective


## The reality of the world

In the beginning there was the word


Image/ video used to be the constant (As something verifiable and taken by truth)
I am in my late 30's I grew with the massification of computers and internet while we still needed a modem connected to the telephone line.

## Invasion of synthetic data
All the knowledge of the word has already been uploaded into the internet
That alone is no

Simulations, digital twinds, 3-D worlds emulating our behaviour, our physics, our way of thinking
So whether it is real or not no longer matters as we are redefining the new meaning of being real.



On friday 13th 2024 Chatgpt 01 PHD level, capable of reasoning, and yet we are not close to AGI


## Redefinitions
Researchers are intending now to rename, give a new meaning to the acronym AI. As for now of artifitial has no longer relevange. It is not artificial, on the contrary, it is very real and a constant, as a developer it is becoming irreplazable and valuable for our daily job
AI = Alien | Augmented Intelligence


This is not intended to be a pessimistic speech, it is relevant that we intend now to be more human approachable, create and engage in communities. 

  We already fail with social media for our lack of knowledge on how our brain works.
  New generations are developing dependency and addiction to not only digital content, but also to synthetic conversations, videogames, and little by little simulations become a cheaper more comfortable way to live a life rather than the one actually known.


Where is this taking us in a capitalist world were leaders insist on making wars were global warming demands prompt advances solutions for our complex problems. And yet.. the application of AI does not seem to meet our final requirements as humanity.

I believe we have the power to change same as we have the power to lift / clean our own shit.
Acknowledge our mistakes, welcome the failure and be open to change of opinion, 

Use the technology, educate yourself and your families, talk about it with your colleagues, your concerns matter and deserve to be listened in forums like this one. 


Image polution image internet contamination



The words do not come up yet, i feel that i have so much to say bur i keep thinking and thinking without getting somewhere
would it be because i thinkg in different languages. i do not feel capable of myself or i am simply exhausted with so many thoughts on my own?

Whatever the sitatuion is I try to find answers fro this presentation but at the same time I cannot. it is like my emotions problems and the conflicts with my wife little by little steal and eat space in my mind, drain mye motions and imprison me to a point it makes it really difficult to begint to operate/coordinate ideas and have better self control/

feeling energetic and with a good lever of energy helps to better have control over my feelings, like if it was always a boiling pot willing to emerge but being cold from time to time, which help diminisht he feelings of anger, remorse, regret, rage, sadness.

problems is what makes me human
feeling
seeing a reality?


How do psychologicla problems emerge

A wolrd dominated by algorithms
Alogrithms controlling what we snould see, think, say, feel

it is likely that we feel ashamed for our overusage of social media in the same way smoking and drinking / lead paint/ radioactive toys are now outrageous and impossible to be

it seems we have learned from our mistakes, and yet....

i feel so focking baddedededede
disspaointned tired, without any spirit fo salvation

salvation
salvation
frustration
forever, eber


what is this iever
ig i ever have i ever
ehat is this
what id this
what is this

who aom i
what am i
when is i tgioing to stiop\22


lets not loose the ability to talk to each other
reasonale conversation are breaking down when we need them the most
with the most advanced technology at hte moment
information is not truth
we are overflodded
we do not have more knowledge nor wisdom
it is rather becoming scarce



# My Speech

Hello everyone, 

Thank you so much for taking part of your time and give me  your attention for the next 30 minutes,
I will try to hold your attention for the next 30 minutes and if I cannot succeed on my attempt I offer my apologies. Really wanted to be at the stage at this day for the things that I want to share and normally talk about among my friends and colleagues. 

Let me tell you that before the Generative AI and agents hype I was already keen and concern for the speed at which technology evolves and change our lives; and the little time we have to adapt, understand and digest the information we consume, the cultural transformation and the impact on societies.

I hope then this topic results as interesting as it is for me and I can contribute to grab your attention into matters like this to make us believe that we do have the power for
* well being,
* deconstruction
* transformation
* re-definition
### (Disclaimer goes here)

But first let me warn you that some of these ideas are a compilation of many writers, researchers and youtubers. All of which resonated on me and let me to share my perspective of our present and future. Arguments like this are based on my own opinion and I invite you to let yourselves feel the uncomfortability of such topics if so. Just please hold your tomatoes.

Before I start please let me raise a samll survey here
How many of you were not born in Norway ? ok, you can thank you//

---- 
Look at this space.. I like the initiative were people interested in those topics have the opportunity to gather, talk and help themselves in those matters
# Human redefinition
What is a human?

Not so long time ago it was a matter of religion to give us a meaning
Things began to tremble as science developed and told us we were no longer sons of good but a gradual evolution of apes capable of thiking, reflecting, using its vocal cords for language and telling stories.

I think back in those days it was easy to fit into a certain social class, religious group, and our tasks/ time would be more mundane.

With the arrival of capitalism and industrial revolution the concept of human transformed into automata, en extension for a machine, a worker an labor capable of operating and transforming / terraforming our world, 


How would you define a human now?
How would you define yourselves

I think and think and for most of the time the words that try to distringuish and classify me as something different from other species rely on:

Biological organism with 4 main extremities, able to talk, see, smell, hear, listen,  think, reflect, AND FEEL

Technology is little by little dismembering us from the qualities that previously would define us, displacing us from being the center of the universe to more than 8 billion individuals with their own opinion, perspective and reality.


What is reality?

Does it really matter now if something that you see is or not?
Because if it feels like to you or is able to change your feelings, affect the way you think, then it no longer matters.

And that is is the reason of my concern. 
I do not know how technological development will lead us to transform into something that will need to be re-defined.

Emergence phenommenon

The possibility that in 3 years we may no longer have to work or trade our time for money


The potential we have to deconstruct ourselves and come back to our roots while at the same time accept technological development as and extension and a tool to outperform.

The dangers of creating synthetic information make it impossible for a single individual to digest, understand and communicate at the speed at which AI agents do it now.

I fear for the time that internet dies for human beings, information becomes so vast that makes is extremely hard for users to sail around it.






I will try not to bombard you with all the things that 


It happens to me know, that i have free time, possiblity to browse the internet, and feel already numb, fool of "cookie " , a youtube video "and have to watch two commercials", a spotify paid subscription and still have to listen to something i did not ask for, a reddit account and still have to scroll up over advertisements every five posts. I check my email and even there i have once more advertisements.

Internet feels like empty to me, even it is  paradoxicaly becoming bigger and bigger

Bit activity is probably more that 80%
