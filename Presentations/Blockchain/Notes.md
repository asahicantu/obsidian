> Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't
want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one
doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively
reveal oneself to the world.

Eric Hughes -> The cryptoAnarchist Manifesto



> “You can pay for access to a database, buy software or a newsletter by email, play a computer game over the net, receive $5 owed you by a friend, or just order a pizza. The possibilities are truly unlimited.”

The cypherpunks were a group of people who met monthly in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1990s to discuss cryptography and privacy. The group was founded by Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John Gilmore1. The technical roots of Cypherpunk ideas can be traced back to work by cryptographer David Chaum on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems

I have been willing to present something about blockchain since it is one of my favourite topis, 
and one of the reasons i want to do it is because it involves so many social and political factors that just conglomerate themselves into an idea, 
a solution that is disrupting the way society works, cooperates and trusts.

I will try my best to explain why is so important now a days, its origins and why it challenges politics, is controversial, contestant and challenges the status quio of modern society


I would like to begin first with a small gallery of people, 

let me know if you know them and lets have some gossip about them shall we?

Snowden
Assange
Zimmemrmann
WEy Dai
CryptoAnarchist movement


[and so on]

These people are the founders of modern cryptography, they called themselves cryptoanarchists and cyberpunks, back in the first cold war, were internet was just being launched and governments controlled
infomration, media etc.
The web 1.0 emerges, and with that a new way of war emerges, on one side governments find a way to 


I would like first to go through a small gallery of people

Will bombard you with some information to try to make sense of the reason why i am showing you this, but before, let me start with this...
