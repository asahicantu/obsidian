## Docker components
* Docker Images Read-only template with instrctions for createing a docker container
* **Container:** Runnable instance of an image
* **Networks:** Network interface to connect the container to external networks using the host machine's network connection
* **Volumes:** Mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by containers
* **Registry:** Private or public registry for Docker images
* **Services:** enablkes multi-host, multi-container deployment

___
The default container format is **libcontainer** and combines the following:
### Namespaces
* Wraps a global system resource in an abstraction (isolated workspace)

* Limits what a container can see (own view of the system)
* Process ID, N/W Interfaces, Inter-process Communications, Filesystem mount points

### Control groups (cgroups)
* Share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints
* Limits how much a container can use (metering & limiting)
* Memory, CPU, block, I/O, network

___
Docker containers can run inside virtual machines
**Capacity optimization** A physical server can host VMs that may house Docker hosts, but may also host any number of traditional monotlithic VMs
