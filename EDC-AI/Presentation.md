* 23 July 2022. Blake Lemoine, (google) gets fired for claiming that LamDA is sentient
* In 2022 we would be certain that words were generated by humans

At the beginning I could not believe it, it was scary to see what the model was capable of doing, dialogs were so deep and could even see myself asking for polite questions ..

#### Has AI become sentient??

note:
We are asking the wrong question…
- AI has managed to "hack the Operating System" of humans

## Anxiety
* March 29th 2023
	*  Calls to stop AI research for 6 months
* Deep fakes
* Generative  *

note: So i started developing anxiety
Start consuming lots of content about catastrophic and bad use of AI
AI learns bengali by itself
Can communicate with animals
Can learn/decipher any known language in the world?
Generative…
	Child pornography
	Movies music..
	How can we defend against that?
	We will need personal agents adapted
	Right to privacy - Never give up privacy
	Hyper -
		Individuality, connectivity
		The extension of respect and indivduality will extend the borders - May be it will be harder
		Sam altman World coin 
		AI Agents

* AI-authored fake reviews
* Forgery (fake content generation)
---
## Depression

### Are we doomed?
* Code in github (Copilots)
* Loss of self consciousness
* Something is  going to break  - out of control

## Barganing

* Machines are tought by machines 
* Write some code to serve other machines 
	* Affect the WWW
* Have own offspring

## Acceptance
* The information you consume <span style="color:red">like it or not</span> will affect your behavior
* Beware of the emergent properties of AI

## Ask  - Conceal

* Why do I  believe what I believe? / What are your values?
* When is it enough? / How much is enough?
* What is it that makes us human?
* Biases and their multiplier effect
* Emotional intelligence Development


note: 
How to stop and be satisfied with what we have
Learn how to be satisfied - not necessarly the happiest
We are very good in acquiring power, but Power does not makes us happy

We are unstoppable, translate power into happiness

Think if it is really necessary to….
The prissoners dilemma
Second order consequences
How do we define sentient, how do we still define consciousness
sentinent [born at a certain point on time]
ability to sense the world environment
Awarenesss and response to the environment


---
##  Regulations in the near future

* Make it mandatory to disclose non-human generated content
* Government protection and regulation
* Enterprise accountability
* Education

---
## Find the balance
 * Develop critical thinking
 * Educate your loved ones

---
## Our challenges as developers
* Use for individual benefit
* Tagging AI generated content 
* Selective privacy
* Create universal accessible systems
---

## Acceptance
#### Do not miss the wave
* Learn to behave ethically
* Reinforcement learning with human feedbacks
* Do not use AI in an unethical way
---
## Acceptance
* This is...
	* Out of my control
	* A new reality
* But I can
	* Spend time and teach my beloved ones
	* Be part of the new social fabric

I've seen things, you people wouldn't believe, hmmm. 	 ... attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. 	I've watched see Beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments, will be lost in time like tears in rain..." Time to die...

What are the current values for humanity so we tan transmit these values to new AI models?

Big world problems solving
* Economic
* Politic
* Social
* Transportation
* Logistics,
* Energy
* Energy storage
	We have to specialize

Happiness = events - expectations

Purpose has been messed up

Whatever happens the answer relies in the collection short-mid-long term  our present decisions

	13:18 AI has become sentient - Google engineer
	31:00 I just told you a story..
AI has the operating system of human kind

Min 29:39


Carl jung y su creencia sobre el espiritismo  / Carl jung modern man

Back to architecture / Architectural behaviour


Resilience of human beings, we will adpat and find our own way,
Let is trust in us being human,
What can I do to add value
Impotence and hopelesness will just block us
Lets put our focus in what we want and not to avoid what I fear

I am one individual and only one
I cannot avoid it
But I cannot give up to what is in my hands, what I can do

Generative AI is making that the variables in the real world which probability used to be infimum will suddenly have a **multiplier effect** in the real world, which will triger exponential and logarithmic phenommenons making what years or months before was improbable a new reality.

How can IA help us be advise for the little we know, for the new things to come

World is just getting more and more complex
It is impossible just for a single human or group of people to assess and get to know things
One one hand we have trusted IA's that can work and help to be advisors
On the other hand we have Biased IA's which we may not fully trust

No human (hardly few of them) truly know how such machines have managed to learn
Be afraid not of the AI tech, but the orchestrators

With big projects, in IT sector, where project plans and budget have been settled for the next 5 years with current technologies, and restrictions .. How can we overcome this Technology gap ?

Think of ourselves as bodies with immune system  - To prevents us be harmed from the exterior ,it will just organically, naturally grow to become a hybrid second personality part of us

Think now that all the jobs that are handled by humans aiming to fulfill repetitive tasks aave the potential of being replaced and substituted by robots, and then coordinated-orchestrated


- And then Github copilot -- is that a must?
- Then we have to acknowledge that from now on most of the code will be generated by AI and not us
- What works for us . In favor of us will eventually might work against us

Just before that researchers spend a year to tune it, tweak it, tag it and use human interaction to refine the model

Our right to data ownership

What will happen to our shadow profiles?
beware of  bubbles...and your own bubbles

Top skill is how you and I connect it very quickly and have a meaninful conversation
If graphic designer is already a must to learn generative
We as developers should be hands on and concern as well on its usage
