You need to build a chatbot that meets the following requirements:  
✑ Supports chit-chat, knowledge base, and multilingual models  
✑ Performs sentiment analysis on user messages  
✑ Selects the best language model automatically  
What should you integrate into the chatbot?  

- **A.** QnA Maker, Language Understanding, and Dispatch
- **B.** Translator, Speech, and Dispatch
- **C.** Language Understanding, Text Analytics, and QnA Maker
- **D.** Text Analytics, Translator, and Dispatch

  
  

Answer : **C**

Language Understanding: An AI service that allows users to interact with your applications, bots, and IoT devices by using natural language.  
QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data. It is used to find the most appropriate answer for any input from your custom knowledge base (KB) of information.  
Text Analytics: Mine insights in unstructured text using natural language processing (NLP)ג€"no machine learning expertise required. Gain a deeper understanding of customer opinions with sentiment analysis. The Language Detection feature of the Azure Text Analytics REST API evaluates text input  
Incorrect Answers:  
A, B, D: Dispatch uses sample utterances for each of your botג€™s different tasks (LUIS, QnA Maker, or custom), and builds a model that can be used to properly route your userג€™s request to the right task, even across multiple bots.
