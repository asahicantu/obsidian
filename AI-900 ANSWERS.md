## Question 2 ( Single Topic )

For a machine learning progress, how should you split data for training and evaluation?  

- **A.** Use features for training and labels for evaluation.
- **B.** Randomly split the data into rows for training and rows for evaluation.
- **C.** Use labels for training and features for evaluation.
- **D.** Randomly split the data into columns for training and columns for evaluation.

  
  

Answer : **B**

The Split Data module is particularly useful when you need to separate data into training and testing sets. Use the Split Rows option if you want to divide the data into two parts. You can specify the percentage of data to put in each split, but by default, the data is divided 50-50. You can also randomize the selection of rows in each group, and use stratified sampling.

Model Explain Ability.  
Most businesses run on trust and being able to open the ML ג€black boxג€ helps build transparency and trust. In heavily regulated industries like healthcare and banking, it is critical to comply with regulations and best practices. One key aspect of this is understanding the relationship between input variables (features) and model output. Knowing both the magnitude and direction of the impact each feature (feature importance) has on the predicted value helps better understand and explain the model. With model explain ability, we enable you to understand feature importance as part of automated ML runs.

Answer : **![](https://img.itexams.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0000900002.png)**

Reliability and safety:  
AI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted. It is important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process.  
An AI system's performance can degrade over time, so a robust monitoring and model tracking process needs to be established to reactively and proactively measure the model's performance and retrain it, as necessary, to modernize it.

Answer : **![](https://img.itexams.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0001300001.png)**

Box 1: Reliability and safety -  
To build trust, it's critical that AI systems operate reliably, safely, and consistently under normal circumstances and in unexpected conditions. These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation.  
  
Box 2: Accountability -  
The people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI systems.  
  
Box 3: Privacy and security -  
As AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business information is becoming more critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with privacy laws that require transparency about the collection, use, and storage of data and mandate that consumers have appropriate controls to choose how their data is used

## Question 18 ( Single Topic )

When you design an AI system to assess whether loans should be approved, the factors used to make the decision should be explainable.  
This is an example of which Microsoft guiding principle for responsible AI?  

- **A.** transparency
- **B.** inclusiveness
- **C.** fairness
- **D.** privacy and security

  
  

Answer : **A**

Achieving transparency helps the team to understand the data and algorithms used to train the model, what transformation logic was applied to the data, the final model generated, and its associated assets. This information offers insights about how the model was created, which allows it to be reproduced in a transparent way.  
Incorrect Answers:  
B: Inclusiveness mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and inclusive design practices can help developers to understand and address potential barriers that could unintentionally exclude people. Where possible, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual recognition technology should be used to empower people with hearing, visual, and other impairments.  
C: Fairness is a core ethical principle that all humans aim to understand and apply. This principle is even more important when AI systems are being developed.  
Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion bias toward a group or individual.  
D: A data holder is obligated to protect the data in an AI system, and privacy and security are an integral part of this system. Personal needs to be secured, and it should be accessed in a way that doesn't compromise an individual's privacy.

Box 1: Model evaluation -  
The Model evaluation module outputs a confusion matrix showing the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives, as well as  
ROC, Precision/Recall, and Lift curves.  
  
Box 2: Feature engineering -  
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that help ML algorithms learn better. In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering. Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are referred to as featurization.  
Note: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For example, a time stamp in itself might not be useful for modeling until the information is transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant to the problem, such as holiday versus working day.  
  
Box 3: Feature selection -  
In machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant, useful features to use in building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of data helps reduce noise and improve training performance.

- **B.** the trip distance of individual taxi journeys
- **C.** the fare of individual taxi journeys
- **D.** the trip ID of individual taxi journeys

  
  

Answer : **B**

The label is the column you want to predict. The identified Featuresare the inputs you give the model to predict the Label.  
Example:  
The provided data set contains the following columns:  
vendor_id: The ID of the taxi vendor is a feature.  
rate_code: The rate type of the taxi trip is a feature.  
passenger_count: The number of passengers on the trip is a feature. trip_time_in_secs: The amount of time the trip took. You want to predict the fare of the trip before the trip is completed. At that moment, you don't know how long the trip would take. Thus, the trip time is not a feature and you'll exclude this column from the model. trip_distance: The distance of the trip is a feature. payment_type: The payment method (cash or credit card) is a feature. fare_amount: The total taxi fare paid is the label.

Box 1: Yes -  
Automated machine learning, also referred to as automated ML or AutoML, is the process of automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.  
  
Box 2: No -  
  
Box 3: Yes -  
During training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through  
ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The higher the score, the better the model is considered to "fit" your data. It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment.  
  
Box 4: No -  
Apply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify.  
The label is the column you want to predict.

Box 1: Yes -  
In machine learning, if you have labeled data, that means your data is marked up, or annotated, to show the target, which is the answer you want your machine learning model to predict.  
In general, data labeling can refer to tasks that include data tagging, annotation, classification, moderation, transcription, or processing.  
  
Box 2: No -  
  
Box 3: No -  
Accuracy is simply the proportion of correctly classified instances. It is usually the first metric you look at when evaluating a classifier. However, when the test data is unbalanced (where most of the instances belong to one of the classes), or you are more interested in the performance on either one of the classes, accuracy doesn't really capture the effectiveness of a classifier.

In the most basic sense, regression refers to prediction of a numeric target.  
Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent variables and a numeric outcome, or dependent variable.  
You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled dataset. The trained model can then be used to make predictions.  
Incorrect Answers:  
✑ Classification is a machine learning method that uses data to determine the category, type, or class of an item or row of data.  
✑ Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.  
Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.

Answer : **![](https://img.itexams.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0007800002.jpg)**

Box 1: Yes -  
For regression problems, the label column must contain numeric data that represents the response variable. Ideally the numeric data represents a continuous scale.  
  
Box 2: No -  
  
K-Means Clustering -  
Because the K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning method, a label column is optional.  
If your data includes a label, you can use the label values to guide selection of the clusters and optimize the model.  
If your data has no label, the algorithm creates clusters representing possible categories, based solely on the data.  
  
Box 3: No -  
For classification problems, the label column must contain either categorical values or discrete values. Some examples might be a yes/no rating, a disease classification code or name, or an income group. If you pick a noncategorical column, the component will return an error during training.

Answer : **![](https://img.itexams.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0009400002.png)**

Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.  
Note: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use.

Box 1: verification -  
  
Identity verification -  
Modern enterprises and apps can use the Face identification and Face verification operations to verify that a user is who they claim to be.  
  
Box 2: similarity -  
The Find Similar operation does face matching between a target face and a set of candidate faces, finding a smaller set of faces that look similar to the target face.  
This is useful for doing a face search by image.  
The service supports two working modes, matchPerson and matchFace. The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.  
  
Box 3: identification -  
Face identification can address "one-to-many" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face. This scenario is used in granting building or airport access to a certain group of people or verifying the user of a device.
